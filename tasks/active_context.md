# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
1. Validating the new filename standardization with YouTube processing
2. Implementing a simplified FastAPI viewer

## Active Tasks
1. Test YouTube processor with the new filename utilities
2. Ensure YouTube files follow the same naming conventions
3. Verify all temporary files are cleaned up properly
4. Implement basic FastAPI viewer with simplified requirements
   - Create minimal backend structure
   - Develop simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend
   - Focus on core content viewing capabilities

## Key Issues Being Addressed
- File serving issues with special characters in filenames (especially `#` characters)
- Path handling and security
- Performance with large video files
- User experience improvements
- Consistency across different content sources (YouTube, Instagram)

## Implementation Progress
1. ✅ Designed consistent filename structure: `{platform}-{username}-{date}-{sanitized_title}`
2. ✅ Implemented filename sanitization to handle special characters and spaces
3. ✅ Created migration tools for existing files
4. ✅ Added integration adapters for processor scripts
5. ✅ Successfully tested with Instagram processing
6. ✅ Successfully tested with YouTube processing
7. ✅ Created simplified FastAPI viewer implementation plan

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic FastAPI project structure in `viewer/`
2. Create core API endpoints for content discovery
3. Implement simple media serving functionality
4. Develop basic frontend with content views
5. Integrate with process_links_manager.sh

## FastAPI Viewer Plan
The FastAPI viewer implementation has been simplified to focus on essential functionality:

1. **Backend**
   - Basic FastAPI application with minimal configuration
   - Simple file system scanner for content discovery
   - Core API endpoints for listing and retrieving content
   - Basic media handling for videos, images, and transcripts

2. **Frontend**
   - Simple HTML/CSS/JS structure without complex frameworks
   - Basic content views for videos, images, and transcripts
   - Minimal styling for readability and usability
   - Basic search and navigation features

The simplified approach prioritizes rapid development and focuses on core content viewing capabilities while removing unnecessary complexity.

## Recent Changes
- Successfully processed Instagram content with new naming conventions
- Modified Instagram processor to use temporary directories for Offmute
- Prevented creation of extra metadata files
- Added script to clean up temporary files
- Created standardized filename utilities in `utils/filename_utils.py`
- Added project documentation about filename conventions to README

## Dependencies
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Python-multipart
- UV package manager

## Current Focus

The project has been successfully set up with all dependencies installed:

1. **Completed Setup**
   - Node.js 22.14.0 and npm 10.9.2 installed
   - FFmpeg 4.4.2 installed
   - UV package manager installed and added to PATH
   - Python virtual environment created and activated
   - All Python dependencies installed via requirements.txt
   - Offmute installed globally
   - Environment variables configured in .env file
   - Notion connectivity verified successfully

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Installation documentation updated with practical experience
   - Environment setup instructions improved
   - Troubleshooting information enhanced
   - README.md installation section refined

The project continues the Phase 2 architectural improvements, with particular emphasis on:

1. **Interactive CLI Interface Development**
   - Implementing a user-friendly command-line interface via `process_links_manager.sh`
   - Adding configuration management capabilities
   - Improving user interaction for platform selection and processing options

2. **Notion Integration Reliability**
   - Fixing intermittent issues with Notion status updates
   - Implementing more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Improving status update logic and validation

## Recent Changes

Recent significant changes to the project include:

1. Complete setup of development environment with all dependencies
2. Enhanced installation documentation with practical experience
3. Successful verification of Notion connectivity
4. Implementation of the processor factory pattern for better extensibility
5. Addition of platform-specific configuration system
6. Enhancement of transcript generation with Gemini API integration
7. Addition of parallel processing capabilities for different platforms
8. Implementation of continuous processing mode

## Known Issues

Current known issues that need to be addressed:

1. Permission issues may arise when installing packages globally
2. Node.js version compatibility is critical for Offmute
3. UV installation may require PATH updates
4. Intermittent Notion API failures during status updates
5. Inconsistent handling of special characters in file names
6. Occasional transcript generation failures for longer videos
7. Rate limiting challenges with Instagram API
8. Content viewer performance issues with large media libraries

## Development Environment

The project is now set up with the following development environment:

1. Python 3.10.12
2. Node.js 22.14.0 and npm 10.9.2
3. UV package manager for dependency management
4. FFmpeg 4.4.2 for media processing
5. Offmute for transcript generation
6. Configured Notion and Gemini API keys

## Testing Strategy

For ongoing development, testing should focus on:

1. Processing real content from the Notion database
2. Transcript generation with Offmute
3. Notion integration reliability
4. Error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Platform-specific processing configurations
6. Interactive CLI functionality
7. Content viewer enhancements
