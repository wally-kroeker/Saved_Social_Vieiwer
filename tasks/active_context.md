# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
1. Completed the FastAPI viewer implementation
2. Implemented dark mode for the content viewer
3. Ready for user testing and feedback

## Active Tasks
1. Gather user feedback on the FastAPI viewer
2. Monitor viewer performance with large content libraries
3. Consider potential enhancements for future iterations

## Key Issues Addressed
- File serving issues with special characters in filenames (resolved)
- Path handling and security in web serving (resolved)
- User experience improvements with responsive design
- Consistency across different content sources (YouTube, Instagram)
- Performance with large video files (partially addressed)

## Implementation Progress
1. ✅ Designed consistent filename structure: `{platform}-{username}-{date}-{sanitized_title}`
2. ✅ Implemented filename sanitization to handle special characters and spaces
3. ✅ Created migration tools for existing files
4. ✅ Added integration adapters for processor scripts
5. ✅ Successfully tested with Instagram processing
6. ✅ Successfully tested with YouTube processing
7. ✅ Created simplified FastAPI viewer implementation plan
8. ✅ Implemented and tested FastAPI viewer with content discovery, viewing, and search

## Next Steps
1. Gather user feedback on the viewer
2. Consider adding advanced search capabilities
3. Explore options for content tagging
4. Plan for additional platform support

## FastAPI Viewer Status
The FastAPI viewer implementation has been successfully completed with the following features:

1. **Backend**
   - FastAPI application with caching and file discovery
   - Clean API endpoints for content listing and retrieval
   - Media handling for videos, images, and transcripts
   - Integration with the process_links_manager.sh script

2. **Frontend**
   - Responsive HTML/CSS layout
   - Clean, modern dark mode interface 
   - Content cards with thumbnails and metadata
   - Video player with transcript and metadata tabs

3. **Features**
   - Content discovery across platform directories
   - Search functionality for titles and usernames
   - Platform filtering
   - Modal-based content viewing
   - Transcript and metadata display
   - Dark mode UI for improved visibility and reduced eye strain

The viewer is now fully functional and can be started using either the management script (`./process_links_manager.sh viewer start`) or manually running the FastAPI server in the viewer directory.

## Recent Changes

1. **Video Player Enhancements**:
   - Made entire video cards clickable for better UX
   - Improved video player modal layout and functionality
   - Added "View Transcript" button to video modal
   - Enhanced video player controls and styling
   - Implemented transcript loading in modal view

2. **Directory Cleanup**:
   - Removed unnecessary files and directories from viewer
   - Streamlined viewer directory structure
   - Improved code organization and maintainability

3. **Previous Changes**:
   - Complete setup of development environment with all dependencies
   - Enhanced installation documentation with practical experience
   - Successful verification of Notion connectivity
   - Implementation of the processor factory pattern for better extensibility
   - Addition of platform-specific configuration system
   - Enhancement of transcript generation with Gemini API integration
   - Addition of parallel processing capabilities for different platforms
   - Implementation of continuous processing mode

## Dependencies
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Python-multipart
- UV package manager

## Current Focus

The project has been successfully set up with all dependencies installed:

1. **Completed Setup**
   - Node.js 22.14.0 and npm 10.9.2 installed
   - FFmpeg 4.4.2 installed
   - UV package manager installed and added to PATH
   - Python virtual environment created and activated
   - All Python dependencies installed via requirements.txt
   - Offmute installed globally
   - Environment variables configured in .env file
   - Notion connectivity verified successfully

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Installation documentation updated with practical experience
   - Environment setup instructions improved
   - Troubleshooting information enhanced
   - README.md installation section refined

The project continues the Phase 2 architectural improvements, with particular emphasis on:

1. **Interactive CLI Interface Development**
   - Implementing a user-friendly command-line interface via `process_links_manager.sh`
   - Adding configuration management capabilities
   - Improving user interaction for platform selection and processing options

2. **Notion Integration Reliability**
   - Fixing intermittent issues with Notion status updates
   - Implementing more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Improving status update logic and validation

## Known Issues

Current known issues that need to be addressed:

1. Permission issues may arise when installing packages globally
2. Node.js version compatibility is critical for Offmute
3. UV installation may require PATH updates
4. Intermittent Notion API failures during status updates
5. Inconsistent handling of special characters in file names
6. Occasional transcript generation failures for longer videos
7. Rate limiting challenges with Instagram API
8. Content viewer performance issues with large media libraries

## Development Environment

The project is now set up with the following development environment:

1. Python 3.10.12
2. Node.js 22.14.0 and npm 10.9.2
3. UV package manager for dependency management
4. FFmpeg 4.4.2 for media processing
5. Offmute for transcript generation
6. Configured Notion and Gemini API keys

## Testing Strategy

For ongoing development, testing should focus on:

1. Processing real content from the Notion database
2. Transcript generation with Offmute
3. Notion integration reliability
4. Error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Platform-specific processing configurations
6. Interactive CLI functionality
7. Content viewer enhancements
