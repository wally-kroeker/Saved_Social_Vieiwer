# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: It took me seven painful years to realize this about consistency. So, here's what I've gathered so you don't make the same stupid mistakes I made. One, consistency isn't about frequency, it's about identity. What do I mean by that? Well, the reason you fail at staying consistent is because you think consistency is about doing the same thing over and over. That is a dangerous mindset. Consistency is about becoming the kind of person who does what needs to be done, no matter what. Stop asking, how do I stay consistent, and start asking, who do I need to become? The moment you shift from, I have to do this to, this is just who I am, consistency becomes effortless. Two, the real enemy of consistency isn't laziness, it's your indecision. You think you struggle with being consistent because you're lazy, but that's not it. The truth is, you haven't decided what truly matters to you. Every time you waffle on your priorities, you break your own momentum. Make a decision, commit to it fully, and eliminate the noise. It's the lack of decision that's killing your consistency, not your lack of effort. But honestly, guys, if I had to leave you with one thing, it would be this, the secret to consistency is turning the things you hate doing into the things you do without thinking. I've added a bonus truth I've learned in the caption below. Go check it out. And I hope you learn from these.
