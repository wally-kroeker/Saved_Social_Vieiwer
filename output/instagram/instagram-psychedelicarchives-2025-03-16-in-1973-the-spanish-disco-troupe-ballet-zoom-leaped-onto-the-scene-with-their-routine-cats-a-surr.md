In 1973, the Spanish disco troupe Ballet Zoom leaped onto the scene with their routine “Cats”—a surreal fusion of dance, funk, and psychedelic spectacle.

Draped in boldly colored jumpsuits, the dancers slink and prowl through a cosmic dreamscape, embodying feline grace with exaggerated, almost hypnotic movements.

The music pulses with a deep, funky groove, perfectly synchronized with kaleidoscopic visuals that swirl in the background, turning the performance into a mind-expanding fever dream.

Ballet Zoom’s “Cats” is more than a dance routine—it’s a psychedelic time capsule, capturing the wild, uninhibited spirit of the ‘70s disco era.
