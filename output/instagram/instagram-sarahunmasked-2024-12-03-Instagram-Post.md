# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: You want a tip for living with somebody who's neurodivergent, particularly autism spectrum, and particularly with the confusion that comes with somebody who is high masking, or sometimes they call it low support needs, where it can seem like they're having a regular conversation with you, but then there's a lot lost in translation. Just a very simple rule of thumb, simple guideline. Say what you mean, but don't say it meanly. Meaning, be super literal, super clear. A lot of the social niceties that neurotypical people use to sort of cushion their language where they say things as a suggestion or as a hint, or they talk around things, that can be really confusing and lead to a lot of misunderstandings. So just be clear, even if you think it's blunt or you think it's rude, being clear is not being rude with a neurodivergent person.
