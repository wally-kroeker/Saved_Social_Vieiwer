# Meeting Description

Okay, here's a consolidated and refined description of the meeting/presentation, addressing the points you requested and resolving any conflicts between the image and audio descriptions:

**1. Who the participants of the meeting were:**

*   **Rupert Spira:** A spiritual teacher specializing in non-duality. He is the primary speaker and leads the discussion.
*   **Unnamed Woman:** Likely a student or attendee at a workshop or talk given by Rupert Spira. She engages in a dialogue with Spira, asking questions and expressing her understanding of the concepts.

**2. Describe the participants:**

*   **Rupert Spira:** The image descriptions indicate a middle-aged man with short, dark hair, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. He appears calm, thoughtful, and uses hand gestures to emphasize his points. His role is that of a teacher or guide, leading the discussion with a philosophical and insightful approach.
*   **Unnamed Woman:** Only her voice is present in the audio, so no visual description is available. Her role is that of a learner, initially holding a conventional view of time, but gradually shifting her perspective through Spira's guidance. Her emotional state evolves from questioning to understanding.

**3. What was discussed? What was shown/covered?**

*   **The Nature of "Now":** The core discussion revolves around the concept of "now" and its relationship to time. Spira challenges the conventional understanding of "now" as a fleeting moment or a point moving along a timeline.
*   **Non-Dualistic Perspective:** The discussion is framed within a non-dualistic philosophical framework (indicated by the "@non_dualism" handle in the images). This perspective emphasizes the illusory nature of separation, including the separation of time into past, present, and future.
*   **Eternal Presence vs. Linear Time:** Spira guides the woman (and the audience) to consider "now" not as a moment *in* time, but as an ever-present, eternal state. He contrasts the idea of a "moving now" with the concept of eternity.
*   **Experiencing the "Now":** The conversation touches upon the direct experience of "now" and how that experience relates to the concept of time.
* **Visual aids:**
    * Text Overlays:
        *   "There is no time. Period."
        *   "as I experience that's when it's now right"
        *   "now is not a moment sandwiched between these two vast spaces"
        *   "the EVER PRESENT not the everlasting"

**4. Additional Information (Meeting Context):**

*   This is likely a recording of a talk, workshop, or Q&A session led by Rupert Spira on the topic of non-duality and the nature of time. It's not a typical business meeting, but rather an educational and philosophical discussion.
*   The setting appears to be informal, possibly a retreat or workshop environment. Spira is seated in a wooden chair, suggesting a relaxed atmosphere.
* The primary goal is to guide the audience/participants towards a deeper understanding of the "now" from a non-dual perspective, challenging their preconceived notions about time.

# Full Transcription

~Rupert Spira~: There is no time. Okay. Period. Is it your experience that the now is moving along a line of time from the past to the future? Is the now moving?

~Unnamed Woman~: No, it's now, now, now.

~Rupert Spira~: How many nows are there? If you say it's now, and now, and now, like how many nows have you experienced during this meeting?

~Unnamed Woman~: As I experience, that's when it's now, right?

~Rupert Spira~: Yes, but how many nows have you experienced, for instance, during this meeting?

~Unnamed Woman~: Only one.

~Rupert Spira~: And today?

~Unnamed Woman~: Only one.

~Rupert Spira~: And in your life?

~Unnamed Woman~: Only one.

~Rupert Spira~: And how long does the now last?

~Unnamed Woman~: I don't think I've ever measured it, but

~Rupert Spira~: It doesn't, it doesn't last. The now doesn't last in time. There is no time for the now to last in. Now is not a moment sandwiched between these two vast spaces. There is no vast space either side of the now. The now is not a moment. We hear about them staying in the present moment, things like that. These are new age ideas. They have nothing to do with with truth or reality. Now is not a moment. Now is eternity. The ever present, not the everlasting.
