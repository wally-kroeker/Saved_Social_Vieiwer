# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: I think somebody who's been really pivotal in talking about this issue, which I'm hoping to have her on the as one of my guests.
I've been talking to her about it.
~Speaker 2~: Yeah?
~Speaker 1~: Uh is uh Brittany Hartley.
Uh she's got a TikTok account if that's still a thing.
Uh Instagram.
No nonsense spirituality is the name of her brand.
It's also the name of her book.
And she is a deconstructed Mormon who actually does a really good job of talking about this from the perspective of a woman and two women in a way that's really meaningful and says a lot of really compelling stuff.
We're probably going to be talking about her book.
So if you want to if you want to get ahead of it, I don't know when we're going to do this, but if you want to get ahead of it and go ahead and read uh Brittany's book, no nonsense spirituality, which if you're somewhere on down the line of deconstruction, if you're like, this is not a book for people who are like still in the in the faith, but it's people who are, you know, trying to figure out what spirituality looks like during and post deconstruction.
I think she talks about it in as compelling of a way as I've I've seen.
So.
