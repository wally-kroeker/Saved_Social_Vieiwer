# Full Transcription

~Woman~: What's a weird fact that keeps you up at night?
~Man~: You cannot become enlightened because you already are enlightened. But your higher self, your Ubermensch, your Christ consciousness, whatever you want to call that, the potential for enlightenment within is already there. There's nothing missing. There's nothing you need to add. You're already entirely all of yourself. There's really just a bunch of stuff you're clinging to that you need to strip away, a bunch of fear or pride or guilt or shame or vanity or anxiety. You don't need to escape a matrix. You don't need to ascend to a higher dimension. You're already in every dimension that you could possibly have access to all at once. It's just about what you're focusing your attention on. You don't need to escape the matrix. You are the matrix. You are your own cage. It's not about breaking free. It's just about letting go.
