# Full Transcription

~Jeremy Alder~: Welcome to Christians You Don't Suck. Today we're talking about the Reverend Pauli Murray. Pauli was a black, queer, non-binary, legal scholar, Episcopal priest, and civil rights trailblazer. If you've never heard of them, it may be because they have a history of upsetting very powerful people who'd like to keep it that way. In fact, just this month, Murray's biography was erased from the National Park Service website following Donald Trump's executive order on gender ideology. 15 years before Rosa Parks, Pauli was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus. Before Brown versus Board of Education, Pauli wrote the legal arguments that helped end school segregation. Before RBG was on the Supreme Court, she cited Pauli's work to win women's rights. For Pauli, God was the great liberator and faith and justice were inseparable. She became the first black woman and first openly queer person ordained as an Episcopal priest. She once wrote, when my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them. Where they speak out for the privileges of a puny group, I shall shout for the rights of all mankind. Hell yeah, Pauli Murray.
