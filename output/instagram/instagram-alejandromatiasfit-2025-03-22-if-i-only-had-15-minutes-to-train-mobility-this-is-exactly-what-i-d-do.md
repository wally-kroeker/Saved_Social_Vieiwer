# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: If I only had 15 minutes to train mobility, this is what I would do. Start with the 90-90 switch. This will train your internal and external rotation. Perform assisted Cossack lunges to stretch out and strengthen your adductors and your groin. Perform cat cow to increase mobility in your thoracic spine through practicing flexion and extension. Now, while keeping your pelvis neutral, shift forward into a runner's lunge and shift out. This will loosen out your tight hip flexors. And from a down dog position, practice the bicycle, which will actively stretch your hamstrings and calves. Now from the table top position, put one hand behind your neck and practice the T-spine twist. This will increase the rotational mobility of your thoracic spine, allowing for more movement in your shoulders. And from the crab position, practice extending your knees and your arms at the same time. This will stretch out your quads and your shoulders. And finally, with a mobility stick or a broomstick, I want you to practice up and overs. This is going to increase your scapular mobility by training flexion, elevation, and retraction.
