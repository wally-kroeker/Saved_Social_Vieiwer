# Full Transcription

~Britt Hartley~: While the country is on fire and there were things to be upset about on both sides of the aisle this weekend, let's check in with your spirituality checklist.
~Britt Hartley~: I'll ask you 10 questions and then give yourself a score 1 to 10 and then add it up and see how you're doing out of a hundred.
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, how honed in are you on your own personal meaning and purpose?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, do you have tools, resources, rituals that help you to process emotion?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, how good is your community, social safety net? Do you have people in your life where you can take off the mask and really share about what it's like being a human for you?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, how do you experience awe and how well do you have whatever that thing is integrated into your life?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, where do you go for inspiration? Do you have something in your life that brings out your best self?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, how's the relationship with yourself? Do you know what's going on kind of bubbling under the surface of your attention? Do you have something that's helping you with the conversation between your conscious and subconscious mind or are you numb to your own experience?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, where are you at with making death into a friend? Is death something that you're having to compartmentalize or believe things that you don't really believe in order to function or do you have tools to actually process the fact that you're going to die and people around you are going to die?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, where are you at with creative expression? Do you have something in your life where you're able to create just for creating, express just for expressing? Are you able to get into a flow state somewhere? Where are you being creative in your life?
~Britt Hartley~: 1 to 10, how well do you know what your core values are and when you look at your life, are you aligned with those core values?
~Britt Hartley~: And last one, 1 to 10, where are you connected outside of yourself? That could be with nature, that could be with causes or ideas, that could be with people, that could be with a community. How good is your connection outside of yourself to something outside of yourself that's bigger than you?
~Britt Hartley~: Doesn't have to be supernatural, just something.
~Britt Hartley~: And of everything on that list, the most important one as far as living a life that's worth living is the first one. How honed in are you on your meaning and purpose?
~Britt Hartley~: If this is where you're struggling, check out my YouTube channel.
