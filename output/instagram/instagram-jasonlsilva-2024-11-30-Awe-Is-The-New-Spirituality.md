# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Beautiful.
~Speaker 1~: Is like, um, new spirituality?
~Speaker 2~: For me, it is.
~Speaker 2~: I think that when I experience awe and wonder, it sounds a lot like a spiritual experience.
~Speaker 2~: You know, I don't use the word spiritual that much because I think it's been corrupted by misuse, by ideologues and and and and forcing people into certain scriptures that maybe don't speak to them and so on and so forth.
~Speaker 2~: And this is the spiritual path that you must follow and so on and so forth and I'm not.
~Speaker 2~: I'm not into that.
~Speaker 2~: But but I am into experiences that are sensorially immersive and that arrest the mind's attention and that in some sense exceed our maps.
~Speaker 2~: So we all create maps to orient ourselves in the world.
~Speaker 2~: That's just called growing up from a child to an adult.
~Speaker 2~: And then as an adult, you kind of live inside your maps, semi-autopilot, you know.
~Speaker 2~: Occasionally something doesn't fit in your maps and you encounter that thing and you pause for a moment and you're like, okay, I notice that.
~Speaker 2~: And then you've quickly incorporated into your maps, you're updated maps and you move on.
~Speaker 2~: But sometimes you encounter a self-transforming machine elf in the middle of a DMT trip or an art piece at Burning Man.
~Speaker 2~: The point is, or the Grand Canyon, or the birth of a child, or an orgasm with a woman that takes your breath away.
~Speaker 2~: The point is you can encounter things that are beyond what you might have ever imagined.
~Speaker 2~: And that opens up a space of obliteration of your maps and a place of virginal noticing.
~Speaker 2~: And that's awe.
~Speaker 2~: It turns out that awe doesn't just feel good, it leaves an afterglow.
~Speaker 2~: Like it's like a medicine that has an effect and the effect is increased compassion, increased well-being, increased humility and it has and uh anti-inflammatory properties.
