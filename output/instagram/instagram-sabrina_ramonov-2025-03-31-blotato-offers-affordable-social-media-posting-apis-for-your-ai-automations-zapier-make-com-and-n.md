~Speaker 1~: If you're building workflow automations in Zapier, Make.com, or n8n, you need an easy way to publish to all the social media platforms. Existing solutions are ridiculously expensive, whereas I priced Blotato to be affordable to everyone, 29 bucks per month for. Check out this YouTube video to learn how to use it with an n8n, and check out this YouTube video to learn how to use it in make.com.
