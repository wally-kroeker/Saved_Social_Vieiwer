We should be preparing kids for life, not jobs. The reality is most of the jobs young kids in school today see will be radically transformed by technology. Instead, we need to set kids up to thrive in a dynamic future underscored by advanced technologies. 

That means fostering adaptability, critical thinking, (among many other skills!) and the ability to build and shape the technologies around them. No matter how the workforce evolves, or how life unfolds, they’ll be ready to navigate change and seize new opportunities.

(This is not an exhaustive list of skills. There are several other examples of skills I’ve shared in previous posts and in lectures).

I got the opportunity to give a talk at @sxsw to over 1000 educators on AI and the future of education. The talk was credited as a course for teachers. Thank you for having me @sxswedu
