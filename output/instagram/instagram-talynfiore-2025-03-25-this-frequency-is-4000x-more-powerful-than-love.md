    *   **Pseudoscience:** The concept of measurable "frequencies" leaving the human body corresponding directly to specific emotions like "authenticity," "anger," or "despair" in the way described is not scientifically validated and falls into the realm of pseudoscience or spiritual belief systems.


# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: the most powerful frequency to leave the human body is, because it is not what you think and it is not love, because everyone is going to assume that it's love, right? I literally just watched this video and wanted to hop on here and tell you this. So, according to this new project called the Spain scale of emotions, Spain is S P A N E, took 25,000 participants and put them in a room, and they were able to measure the frequency coming out of the human body to such accuracy that they could compare anger to despair, passion to elation, like, that's how specific they could get on this. Do you want to know what the most powerful frequency to leave the human body is?

~Speaker~: Authenticity.

~Speaker~: Authenticity was measured to be 4,000 times more powerful than love. How crazy is that? Love is so important, and if you think about the ego, you have to go through love to get to authenticity. And what is authenticity? Authenticity is when your words are truthful and you believe what you say. So get out there today and be authentic. Of course, love, always love, but we want to make sure that you are loving from a place of authenticity, not from a place of trying to gain other people's love or gain attention, but just authentically being yourself is the most powerful thing you can do today. Let me know your thoughts.
