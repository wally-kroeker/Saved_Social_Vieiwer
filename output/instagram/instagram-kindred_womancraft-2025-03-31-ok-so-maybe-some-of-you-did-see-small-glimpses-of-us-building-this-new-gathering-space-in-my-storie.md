Ok, so maybe some of you did see small glimpses of us building this new gathering space in my stories, but nothing compared to the amount of work that has gone into building this space.

My talented husband is the one that brought this incredible space to life with the epic Zome plans we bought from @trilliumdomes (you should check them out).

For many years it has been a dream of mine to create a stand alone gathering space, and one day it unexpectedly all just aligned. 

After a surprisingly successful launch with my online course “Holding Space”, finding the perfect Zome plans from @trilliumdomes, and my husband having the time to actually build it.

And so we started to slowly build the space between work and life in August and now it is (almost) finished. 

I still can’t quite believe it!

We had only ever seen these Zomes online in photos and videos, but  I can say now that they don’t even compare to the space in person. They are absolutely beauty full, transporting and magical!

And my goodness, the acoustics are extraordinary!

I feel so incredible blessed to now have this space to gather in for women’s circle, song weaving, medicine drum crafting, ceremonies, 1:1 work and more! 

It feels really good after our first two weeks using the space to take the time to make this little video and celebrate all the work that went into its creation. And to celebrate the incredible skills of my husband who this dream could never be possible without. Love you Bibi!

Can’t wait to begin offering more gatherings in this space next term❤️‍🔥
