# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Here comes 10 things happy people spend zero time worrying about.

~Speaker 1~: Holding grudges. They're actually kind of heavy. That's where the term chip on the shoulder comes from. Let them go and lighten the load. Comparing yourself to others. It's a waste of time because no one is the unique blend that you are. Instead, work on discovering and enhancing your unique blend. That will bring your gifts to the world.

~Speaker 1~: Worrying about the future. The future is actually an illusion. The past is now delusion. So just focus on the here and now.

~Speaker 1~: Perfectionism. It's one of the greatest causes of depression.

~Speaker 1~: Negative self-talk. Listen to what you're saying to yourself and make sure it's positive. You are your own best friend or worst enemy. Definitely become the friend.

~Speaker 1~: Dwelling on past mistakes. Instead of dwelling on them, just learn the lesson and then grow and move on.

~Speaker 1~: The need to please everyone. People pleasing will get you nowhere except a lot of phony relationships.

~Speaker 1~: Fear of change. Fear is often a sign actually to go forward, especially if it's just our own limiting beliefs that are holding us back. So yeah, don't let fear ever stop you.

~Speaker 1~: Regret. Regret is also another emotional waste of time. You want to simply learn the lesson, not sit there regretting, which will just inject cortisol, that's the hormone of stress throughout your body.

~Speaker 1~: And finally, happy people don't worry about what other people think of them. They worry about what they think of themselves. So make sure what you're doing in your private and public life is something you're happy about, proud about, then it really doesn't matter what other people think.
