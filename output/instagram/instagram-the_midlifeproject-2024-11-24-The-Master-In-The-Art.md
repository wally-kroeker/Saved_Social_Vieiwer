# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: recently went through his desk and I found this poem and I read the poem over and I went, man, that's how my dad lived his life.
The poem goes like this.
A master in the art of living draws no distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which.
He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves it up to others to decide whether he is working or playing.
To himself, he's always doing both.
