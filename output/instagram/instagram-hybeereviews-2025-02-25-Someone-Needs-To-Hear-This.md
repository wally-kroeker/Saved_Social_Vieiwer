# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: I've been in a relationship for two years, and my boyfriend and I have never fought.
~Speaker 1~: It's not because we're that compatible, it's because I literally studied interpersonal psychology.
~Speaker 1~: Oh my god, I am so passionate about this.
~Speaker 1~: Especially in a relationship, it shouldn't be me versus you.
~Speaker 1~: It's us versus the confusion of understanding each other.
~Speaker 1~: For my Ivy League psychology degree, I literally spent an entire semester in a class called perception.
~Speaker 1~: And the next word you need to know is perspective.
~Speaker 1~: While perception and perspective seem kind of similar, they're actually very different.
~Speaker 1~: Perception is your subjective experience of the world using your five senses.
~Speaker 1~: But perspective is understanding and recognizing that everyone has their own unique perception of the world.
~Speaker 1~: When most couples fight or argue, it's usually got to do with some sort of communication error about where each party is coming from.
~Speaker 1~: One person is saying one thing, the other person is saying something else, and it's not getting through to each other.
~Speaker 1~: And it's usually because even from the same factual event that happened, people can have infinite different interpretations.
~Speaker 1~: Okay, I can go off about this because I'm kind of a nerd in this field, but what can you use?
~Speaker 1~: What can I actually incorporate?
~Speaker 1~: The goal is clarity.
~Speaker 1~: It's clearing the confusion, not.
~Speaker 1~: And I think that's why my boyfriend and I never fight because when I don't agree with something he's doing, I'll just ask him to clarify.
~Speaker 1~: Like, can you explain that to me in more detail?
~Speaker 1~: Because my small brain is not comprehending what you're saying, but the more you explain, I think I might understand your perspective.
~Speaker 1~: I had to spend an entire semester learning this, but cheers to learning things faster on the internet.
