# Full Transcription

~[Speaker Name]~: Why would a smart person believe in tarot cards? That's something I get asked an awful lot. And while I do appreciate the insinuated compliment that I am in fact a smart person, it seems to me that the disconnect here usually stems from other people's assumptions, which is to say what they believe people who believe in tarot cards are supposed to believe as opposed to what I actually believe about tarot cards. So here's what I actually do believe. Firstly, I don't claim to predict the future or believe that I can. I don't communicate with ghosts or spirits. I don't think that these cards have magical powers. I think that these are bits of cardboard with pictures on them. And those pictures are symbols. Those symbols, however, I do find very interesting. I kind of think of this as a book of philosophy written in symbolic imagery rather than in regular language. Now the reason I think these symbols are interesting is because they're kind of universal, right? A lot of very similar symbols come out of a lot of similar stories from very different cultures from all sorts of time periods from all over the world. Almost as if we're all the same species using the same brain to describe and experience of the same reality and therefore arriving at the same conclusion. In fact, you could argue, and I do, that all of human civilization is just a story made of symbols, right? A game that we're all playing with each other that only functions because we believe that the symbols are real. Money is a symbol. It represents value. A policeman's badge is a symbol. It represents authority. I think this is true about the way we perceive reality on a deeper, more abstract level as well. Now I think that means that there's an awful lot to learn, both collectively and individually from examining and studying and considering symbols. But like I said, the cards aren't really magic. They don't teach you anything. The understanding has to already be within you. Sometimes we need external tools to help us access internal wisdom laying dormant waiting to be made clear. Similar to how you could experience an epiphany from going for a walk in the woods or listening to a piece of beautiful music, right? The music didn't expressly tell you information. It just stirred the pot in exactly the right way. It loosened the right screw or fiddled the right knob to help you open the floodgate. I think that symbols that are at the core of the human experience can be very useful for that because well you're a human trying to enhance your experience. Now if you are still here, I assume you might be a little bit interested in booking a personal reading with me, which is something I do offer. If you follow the link in my bio, I have two options, either 35 minutes or a full hour. After you make a booking, I will reply to you with whichever email you use to make the booking. And if you have any questions in advance, you can shoot me a DM.
