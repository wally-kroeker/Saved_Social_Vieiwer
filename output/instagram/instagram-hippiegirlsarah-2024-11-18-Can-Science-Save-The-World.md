# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: American environmental lawyer and advocate Gus Speth once said, I used to think the top environmental problems facing our world were global warming, environmental degradation, and ecosystem collapse. And we scientists could fix those with enough science. But I was wrong. The real problem is not those three items, but greed, selfishness, and apathy. And for that, we need a spiritual and cultural transformation. And we scientists don't know how to do that.
