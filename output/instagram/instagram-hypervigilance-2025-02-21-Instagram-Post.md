# Full Transcription

~[Speaker]~: Right. I mean, the future is going to be Ready Player One, but if it were directed by Lars von Trier, not Steven Spielberg. It's going to be really dark. Like people just like nodding off, shitting their pants, plugged into whatever the metaverse or matrix is, just like it's dope. You know, that like like like these new kind of technological things that take us out of reality are literally the new drugs. That's what we should be viewing these as, that they're actually praying on our dopamine centers. All of this kind of so-called quest for engagement is a euphemism for targeted addictions, utilizing the understandings of reward delivery services within the human mind. And so, one thing people really aren't understanding is how how fucked we are in our our ability to kind of like live in a shared reality and how easy it's going to be for people like the Trump administration to create completely alternate realities, utilizing AI to create things that didn't happen, but also utilizing AI to deny things that do. Oh, that's just AI. You can see them doing it already. And so, um, we're going to be living in a dystopia that that a huge chunk of the people think is a utopia. Yeah, they're all totally confused. It's like watching Elon Musk destroy the government, do the most corrupt thing in the history of this country that we've seen happening out in the open, and then they're like calling it fighting corruption. We live in the upside down and it's only going to get worse. Um, any relationship with a narcissist is a tug of war for reality and Donald Trump's reality is winning. It's taken over our our kind of media structures, it's taken over our legal system, and despite the fact that we know that it's an inverted, distorted, disordered reality, it's a reality that we have to take seriously because so many people are fucking lost in it. It's it's it's a kind of 70 million person cult. It's not like a cult. It is a cult. And so part of that is is just not seeing reality. And the way that reality is now being created online and exported offline and and the online reality is replacing the offline reality in people's internal conceptions of reality. And that online reality is completely manipulated and controlled by Agent Smith. I mean, I mean Elon Musk. And the other tech lords and the other people that are controlling our understandings of reality. Like reality is now algorithmic based. Everybody's living in their own reality because everybody's consuming their own algorithm.
