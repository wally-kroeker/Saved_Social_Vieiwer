# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: I don't want to be enough for any of my partners. I want to be essential. I want to be loved in different ways at different times. There are times when I want to let my hair down and burp comfortably. There are times when I want to engage in the novelty and the mystery and the fire of new relationship energy. I can't require that all from one person. I cannot be all of that for one person. I want to love in a way that is truthful to me without chasing this imaginary construct of enoughness that leaves myself behind. Because if I leave myself behind, who is doing the loving? Who is being loved? So, for example, when I'm not spending time with them, I get to encounter myself in the experience of yearning and see that part of myself. Because if I'm spending all of my time with them, I don't know who I am outside of my relationship with them. My desire to dissolve this requirement of enoughness is what directs me to be unequivocally selfish in how I want to love freely and truthfully.
~Speaker 1~: When I'm selfish about my freedom, I start advocating fiercely about my partner's freedom. And we find ourselves no longer interested in being enough because we're so busy being essential for each other's experience of freedom.
