# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Hey, good morning. James Clear popularized the quote, we don't rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems. Yep. There's no shortage of people setting out to do hard things, but there's a huge shortage of people actually doing those things. And it's not because of lack of potential. Look, you don't magically become more capable just because you want to do something. You do become more capable when you commit yourself to reliable routines, structure, systems. A system can be a lot of things. It can be scheduled, it can be planning, prepping, thinking about things ahead of time, saying no to things you usually say yes to, setting boundaries, quitting. Systems can be daily practices. Systems can be things that you only do once a week. Systems a lot of the time become habits. But fundamentally, what a system is is a framework that makes the daily process of doing the things required to get where you want to go as easy as possible. A system removes barriers. Think about it, do your goals do any of that? No. It's not about doing on a day, it's about doing every day. It's systems.
