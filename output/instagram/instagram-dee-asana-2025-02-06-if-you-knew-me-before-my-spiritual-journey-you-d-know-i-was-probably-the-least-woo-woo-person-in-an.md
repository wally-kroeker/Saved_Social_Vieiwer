If you knew me before my spiritual journey, you’d know I was probably the least woo-woo person in any room. Spirituality? Meditation? Energy work? Yeah, none of that was on my radar. I was just out here partying, living my best life and thinking that was it.

But then life (aka the universe) humbled me. I got sick. I had no choice but to slow down, sit with myself and actually listen to my body, my mind and my spirit. That’s when everything cracked open. Yoga wasn’t just stretching—it was a reset. Meditation wasn’t just sitting in silence—it was clarity. Rituals weren’t just routines—they became portals.

And now? Let’s just say I look back and laugh at the version of me who thought I had it all figured out. Because the truth is, I was raw-dogging life for no reason.

So if you’ve been side-eyeing all this woo-woo stuff but haven’t actually tried it… maybe this is your sign.
