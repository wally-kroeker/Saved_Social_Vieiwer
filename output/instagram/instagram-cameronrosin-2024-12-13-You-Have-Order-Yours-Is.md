# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: ADHD is no longer a term I think is resonating with who you actually are.
It was helpful for a time, gave you a collection of terms to relate to yourself through, but you are more than a walking collection of pathologies.
You are a multi-passionate, multi-potentialite, Renaissance soul.
And it might be time to expand this vocabulary of self because you don't have any deficit of attention, you have an abundance.
You are not disordered, you are just a greater order, the order of clouds that gather and break in the sky above, the order of many streams converging into one.
You are an archetype that builds and breaks paradigms.
