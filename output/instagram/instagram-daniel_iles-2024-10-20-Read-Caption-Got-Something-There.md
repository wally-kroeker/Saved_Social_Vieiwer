# Full Transcription

~[Speaker Name]~: That's how we create about a year's worth of content in four hours. I did this myself, got 200 million views in literally one four-hour filming session. First, we put together a list of 10 competitors, people on social media that your audience is already watching, whether they're selling the same exact thing or just tangentially related. If your target audience is watching their content, you need to be paying attention to them. Then you hit follow on that account and you get a list of suggested accounts. Follow all of those. Now we're up to a list of about 20 people that are all killing it on social media. Now we're going to grab the top 100 posts from every account and organize it by view count. You just have a VA do this or have my team run the software that pulls it automatically and it'll even transcribe all those videos for you. Now you're going to be left with about two to 3,000 of the best videos in your niche to draw inspiration from. If you want to make your own version of every single one of those, that's eight years worth of content posting daily. But if you only recreate the videos that you can uniquely speak on, you're going to end up with millions and millions of views.
