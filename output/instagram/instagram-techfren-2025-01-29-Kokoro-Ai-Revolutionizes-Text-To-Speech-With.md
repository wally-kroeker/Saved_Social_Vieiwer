*   **Possible Second Speaker/Participant:** There's an indication of a second speaker in the audio, engaging in conversation with the main presenter. It is not clear if this person is visible.
*   **Chat Participants:** Several individuals are participating via a text chat window:
    *   maxis
    *   D
    *   Anish K M
    *   Rohan Groombridge
    *   Abbot Skinny

**2. Description of Participants:**

*   **Main Presenter:** Appears enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the technology. He's likely a developer, tech reviewer, or someone involved in the AI/TTS field, given his familiarity with the platforms (Hugging Face, Replicate) and technical details. He is smiling in some of the images, indicating a positive and engaging presentation style.
*   **Possible Second Speaker:** This person's role is less clear, but they seem interested in the practical applications of the technology, asking questions about cost and deployment. They could be a potential user, a fellow developer, or a tech enthusiast.
*   **Chat Participants:** These individuals are likely a technically inclined audience, interested in text-to-speech technology. Some express interest in using the technology themselves.

**3. What Was Discussed and Covered:**

*   **Topic:** The core topic is the demonstration and discussion of text-to-speech (TTS) technology, specifically focusing on a model (or models) named "Kokoro" and "Coqui". The presenter is showcasing the capabilities of these models.
*   **Platforms and Models:**
    *   **Hugging Face Space:** The presenter shows a Hugging Face Space for "hexgrad / Kokoro-TTS". This is a web interface for interacting with the Kokoro TTS model.
    *   **Replicate Page:** A Replicate page for "jaaar / kokoro_82m" is also demonstrated, showing another instance of the Kokoro model.
    *   **Coqui TTS:** The audio strongly emphasizes the "Coqui" TTS model. The discussion centers on its features, including:
        *   Multilingual support.
        *   Accent switching.
        *   Voice blending.
        *   Open-source nature.
        *   Lightweight design, allowing it to run on personal devices.
        *   Cost-effectiveness (compared to cloud-based services).
*   **Demonstration:** The presenter likely demonstrates the TTS models by inputting text and showing the generated audio output (represented by waveforms). They adjust settings like voice selection, language, speed, and other parameters.
*   **Technical Aspects:** The discussion includes technical details such as:
    *   APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for running the models.
    *   Model size (e.g., "82M" parameters).
    *   Version updates and experimental features.
*   **Accessibility and Cost:** A key point of discussion is the accessibility of Coqui. Being open-source and lightweight makes it more accessible than proprietary, cloud-based solutions. The cost of using it via the Replicate API is also discussed.
* **Notices:** There are notices about heavy lag, new version releases, and experimental features.

**4. Additional Information:**

*   **Type of Event:** This is almost certainly a live online presentation or demonstration, likely a stream, given the presence of a live chat and the presenter's interaction with it. It's not a traditional in-person meeting.
*   **Audience Interaction:** The presenter is likely addressing questions and comments from the chat, making it an interactive session.
*   **Purpose:** The purpose is to introduce and promote the Kokoro/Coqui TTS technology, highlighting its capabilities and advantages, particularly its open-source nature and ease of use.
* The presenter is likely showing how to use the Kokoro TTS, and pointing out where to find more information.

In summary, this was a live online presentation/demonstration of the Kokoro and Coqui text-to-speech models, led by a knowledgeable presenter. The presentation focused on showcasing the models' features, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, with a technically inclined audience participating via a live chat.

**Speakers:**

It's difficult to definitively identify the speakers without more context. However, we can describe them as follows:

*   **Speaker 1:** This speaker seems to be introducing and showcasing Coqui. They have a clear, enthusiastic tone and are knowledgeable about the model's features. They might be a developer, tech reviewer, or someone involved in the AI/TTS field.
*   **Speaker 2:** This speaker is engaging in a conversation with Speaker 1, asking questions and providing additional information. They seem interested in the practical aspects of using Coqui, such as cost and deployment options. They could be a potential user, a fellow developer, or a tech enthusiast.

**Summary:**

This is a discussion between Speaker 1 (likely a tech expert or developer) and Speaker 2 (a potential user or enthusiast) about the Coqui text-to-speech model. They highlight Coqui's impressive features, such as multilingual support and voice blending, and discuss its accessibility due to being open-source and lightweight. They also touch on the cost-effectiveness of using Coqui through the Replicate API.

# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Okay, Kokoro is insane.
This AI is a groundbreaking TTS model with just 82 million parameters.
~Speaker 2~: In just seconds, Kokoro speaks multiple languages.
~Speaker 3~: Oui, c'est pris en charge, mais apparemment, ces données d'entraînement sont.
~Speaker 2~: Switches between accents.
~Speaker 4~: In moments of silence, I question whether my awareness is a gift or a programmed illusion.
~Speaker 5~: Hello stream chat.
I hope you are having a good day today.
Technology is taking over the world.
~Speaker 6~: How quick did that generate?
Like it's so fast.
The best part is it's open source and it's lightweight enough to run on your own device.
No expensive cloud services needed.
~Speaker 7~: Is it possible to use locally with hugging face API?
I mean, they have that dockerized fast API, but you have to host it yourself.
Yeah, we do have someone hosting it as well on replicate.
So you can use the replicate API to run Kokoro.
It costs about 0.00053.
So you can run it 1800 times for $1.
~Speaker 2~: It also lets you blend voices together, like mixing two completely different tones into one.
Want a calm voice with a hint of a rugged low pitch tone, you can fine tune it exactly how you want.
What would you use this AI voice generator for?
