# Full Transcription

~Trevor Noah~: learned rules now for myself, and for anyone out there really, especially if you have ADHD. Before you go through anything or before you think about anything intently and intensely when you're struggling, ask yourself a few simple questions. Have you slept? Have you eaten well? eaten good food? Have you moved your body? And have you spent a little time breathing? If you answer yes to all of those questions, you can continue to pontificate about the meaning of life and everything that you're going through. If you have not, just fulfill all of them and then see if you're still feeling the same on the other side, and you'll be shocked how often times you aren't. The one thing that would happen to me, this is this is so ridiculous, I know. Sometimes when I'd be in that place, I'd feel a little hopeless, right? And I would think to myself, I hate this, this sucks. I I I don't know what I want to do with life anymore. Never like suicidal, but just like I just don't know if this life thing, what is this? And then I would go, if if it was going to end tomorrow, then what what would I do like today then? I'd be like, I'm going to do I'm going to go on stage. I'm going to tell that joke that I've been terrified to tell. I'm just going to say it because I'm leaving anyway. Life is ending, it's going, it's all going away because it's all going to shit, right? Just going to say that. Go tell that joke. I'll be like, I should also I should also I should also throw a party. Life's ending anyway, so just throw like one, just like one just like fuck off party that you just like go into it and and and I'll I'd think of all the things and I I mean this genuinely. I think of all the things that I would do with like giant middle fingers on my way out. And the smile that it brings to my face, I can't explain to you because every time it makes me realize that that's all I should be trying to do. Not in a in a way where I don't I don't consider other people, but it's what I should be trying to do. And it's made me realize that at times, not everyone, but for me and I think some people would probably feel this. Sometimes what's happened in our lives, and I know I had this is like you feel like you don't you don't realize that you've stopped sort of like running, jumping, smiling, screaming, you've stopped being everything you can be and you've just you've started existing as one version of yourself. And sometimes just having the idea of just, you know what I mean, take all your clothes off and run through the streets screaming and and what would you say and who would you say it to and why would you say? You'd be shocked at how that gives you an inkling of what you are not doing for yourself. Some people might be like, I'll tell my dad to go screw himself. I would say to you, oh, this is probably you realizing that you don't set boundaries with your dad and you don't communicate well. Maybe you don't tell your dad how you hurt your feelings or I man, I'll I'll go to work and I'll well maybe this is not the job for you. I'll I'll party all night. Maybe you're not taking enough time to have fun. I'll you'll be shocked at how like sometimes you're it's not it's not a tantrum, but it's just like your your screw you choice is what you sort of should be doing in a in a in a in a responsible way. And and that I promise you now in all those moments where I felt like it's hopeless were the moments where I'd come back even more. I think to myself, maybe I should try aiming to get to that place. And therein in a strange way lies the meaning for me.
