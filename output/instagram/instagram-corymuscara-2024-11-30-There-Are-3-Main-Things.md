# Full Transcription

~Cory Muscara~: Think about this for a moment. Your awareness of your pain is not in pain. Your awareness of your boredom is not bored. Your awareness of your fear is not afraid. So when you find yourself absorbed in an unpleasant experience, take a deep breath and become aware of the part of you that is able to observe your experience without becoming it. Because it's this part of you that is the key to your inner freedom.
