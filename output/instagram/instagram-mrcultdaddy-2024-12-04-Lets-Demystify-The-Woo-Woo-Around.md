~Speaker~: If you have ever struggled with the how or why when it comes to meditation, this video is going to help you out a lot.
~Speaker~: Now, in my content, we've been talking a lot about the human computer.
~Speaker~: If you haven't seen this video, you need to watch it.
~Speaker~: But I'll give you a quick recap.
~Speaker~: You are literally a computer.
~Speaker~: A computer's short-term memory, the memory in the CPU, is like your conscious mind.
~Speaker~: If you overload it, it's going to be super buggy.
~Speaker~: Subconscious mind is your hard drive.
~Speaker~: It's the long-term storage.
~Speaker~: This is where your operating system, your applications are.
~Speaker~: To upgrade your operating system, it takes space.
~Speaker~: You cannot do it if you don't have space.
~Speaker~: So you need to clear your cache, clear your mind, clear space.
~Speaker~: When you do this, this is why people talk about receiving downloads.
~Speaker~: That's what it is.
~Speaker~: It's a download.
~Speaker~: But let's demystify how you do that.
~Speaker~: So your brain waves exist at various frequencies.
~Speaker~: To clear and create space, you want to be in the alpha or theta brainwave state.
~Speaker~: Right here.
~Speaker~: There is no magic when it comes to meditation.
~Speaker~: It is a technique to get your brain into these states.
~Speaker~: And I've got great news.
~Speaker~: There are so many ways to get into these states.
~Speaker~: First, let's talk about techniques to get into the alpha state.
~Speaker~: You can do things like fine crafts, beadwork, embroidery, knitting.
~Speaker~: The fine motor skills required, plus the attention you're giving it, engage your default mode network.
~Speaker~: Repetitive tasks also reduces stress hormones like cortisol, which helps you get into the alpha state.
~Speaker~: Then you have standard meditative practices.
~Speaker~: Focusing on a single task helps you reduce your mental chatter, which will put you in the alpha brainwave state.
~Speaker~: There's many techniques to this.
~Speaker~: I'll talk about it in future videos.
~Speaker~: Because you just need to find one that works for you.
~Speaker~: You have things like mindful walking through nature, or as the Japanese call it, Shinrin Yoku, which is forest bathing.
~Speaker~: Something as mindfully focusing on every single step is going to reduce your sensory overload, sending you into the alpha state.
~Speaker~: It's all different breathing techniques.
~Speaker~: I highly recommend you guys go check out.
~Speaker~: I'll do like a 10-minute breath work before I meditate and the efficiency just shoots up.
~Speaker~: You can use binaural beats or frequencies.
~Speaker~: Art and music are also powerful tools.
~Speaker~: Creating puts you into the creative flow.
~Speaker~: The creative flow is literally alpha theta brainwave.
~Speaker~: You don't have to be good.
~Speaker~: You're not doing it to be good.
~Speaker~: You are doing it to achieve these states of mind, which anybody can do.
~Speaker~: Now let's talk about the theta state, which is a deeper state.
~Speaker~: There are deeper styles of meditation like transcendental meditation.
~Speaker~: You have Yogi Nidra, hypnosis or self-hypnosis.
~Speaker~: You bypass your critical mind and access your subconscious theta waves.
~Speaker~: Accessing your subconscious is how you reprogram yourself.
~Speaker~: This is why positive affirmations work.
~Speaker~: Sound healing.
~Speaker~: You have Tibetan singing bowls.
~Speaker~: You can use theta binaural beats.
~Speaker~: Low frequency sounds pull you into those frequencies.
~Speaker~: You can learn to lucid dream.
~Speaker~: You can do sleep practices, guided sleep meditations.
~Speaker~: You can do repetitive systems like chanting mantras, repeating prayers, repeating positive affirmations.
~Speaker~: And I want to tell you why this one is such a powerful tool.
~Speaker~: When you put on a shirt, you feel the fabric.
~Speaker~: Is it comfortable, uncomfortable, soft, stiff?
~Speaker~: Eventually your brain ignores it.
~Speaker~: Your shirt is still on your body.
~Speaker~: You don't feel it anymore.
~Speaker~: That is called sensory adaptation.
~Speaker~: Your brain is ignoring the constant stimuli because it doesn't need to pay attention to it.
~Speaker~: When you repeat things over and over, initially your brain is paying attention.
~Speaker~: It's very conscious to it.
~Speaker~: But then it begins to ignore it through habituation, which is a form of sensory adaptation.
~Speaker~: As that repetition becomes automatic, your analytical conscious mind begins to disengage.
~Speaker~: This allows your subconscious mind to take over.
~Speaker~: All of these are tools that take you from programmed to becoming conscious, to becoming aware.
~Speaker~: And when you're aware, you can become the programmer.
~Speaker~: You access your subconscious mind and you say, you know what, fear-based thinking doesn't serve me, gone.
~Speaker~: It's not a part of my programming anymore.
~Speaker~: Here's certain habits, things that I struggle with that don't serve me anymore, gone, because I am the programmer.
~Speaker~: I get to decide.
~Speaker~: There are so many methodologies and techniques to get your brain into these states.
~Speaker~: I can't list them all.
~Speaker~: Find something that works for you.
~Speaker~: It's not one size fits all.
~Speaker~: It may even help starting with something like beadwork and doing that for a time before you move on to more advanced meditation techniques.
~Speaker~: There is no magic to it.
~Speaker~: There is no woo-woo to it.
~Speaker~: There are many different tools and ways to build a house.
~Speaker~: Pick the one that serves you.
~Speaker~: I love you guys.
