# Full Transcription

~Dan McClellan~: The sexual ethic of the Bible is entirely irrelevant to today, if you think of sex as something that two equal partners mutually engage in. Hey everybody, I'm Dan McClellan. I'm a scholar of the Bible and religion. And while the sexual ethics of the Bible differ significantly from one part to another, what undergirds all of it is a view of sex as something that an active sexual agent did to a passive sexual object. And there are two very significant consequences of that view of sex that we overwhelmingly reject today. The first is a socially conventionalized hierarchy of domination and penetration, because sexual agency only flowed downstream. Again, this is something an agent did to an object. The will, the agency, the consent of that object was irrelevant. And this is why in the Hebrew Bible, for instance, we see the vilification of male same sex intercourse, because that subordinates and subjugates a male to another male sexually, which violates his position at the pinnacle of that hierarchy. That was not allowed. This is also why female same sex intercourse is entirely ignored throughout the entire Hebrew Bible. Another manifestation of this hierarchy is the widespread idea that we see in ancient Mesopotamia, that we see in early Judaism, that was all over the ancient world, that it was inappropriate for a man to take the bottom position during sex with his own wife, because that was a submissive position, and that was a violation of this social hierarchy of domination. It's also why we have in Leviticus 18 and 20, these laws about what kind of sexual partners men are prohibited from having. And there's only one part of those two chapters that prohibits a woman from a specific sexual partner. And it's the only time a sexual partner for a woman could be lower than her on the hierarchy of domination. And that is when the passive partner is an animal. So from beginning to end throughout the Bible, we see this notion that there is a hierarchy that cannot be violated, and that is what results in the specific sexual ethics that the Bible has. Now, when we get to Greco Roman period Judaism, there is an influx of Greek philosophy, which results in some more parity between men and women, not total equality. Women are still subordinate to men, but a bit more parity. And this is primarily the result of the philosophical idea that sexual desire is one of the baser urges of the flesh and should be ideally avoided and overcome. And so this is why the sexual ethic that sits closer to the surface in the New Testament is that of folks like Paul and Matthew, where celibacy is the ideal. You want to be celibate. And Paul says if you can't hack celibacy, it's better to marry than to burn. And procreation plays absolutely no role here. Paul couldn't have cared less about procreation. He thought Jesus was coming back too quickly for anyone to get pregnant anyway. No, you married so that you could have occasional prophylactic sex to keep down the urges. Now, the other consequence of this view of sex was the commodification of that passive sexual object. And we see this in a bunch of different ways. For instance, marriage was not an equal partnership. It was a man purchasing from another man the sexual availability and the procreative capacities of a woman. And it was expected to have that shiny new car smell, which is why sexual assault was considered such a serious crime, because it basically rendered the woman tainted goods. It wasn't a crime against her. It was a crime against the possessor of her sexual availability and procreative capacities. If she was already engaged to be married, it was a crime against the property rights of the husband, and the penalty was death. If a woman was not yet engaged or married, it was a crime against the father who stood to benefit financially from her marriage. And so the primary penalty was a fine, and the secondary penalty was that you had to marry and or in some way provide for the well being of this woman who is now damaged goods in the eyes of proper Israelite society. So you have both the objectification and the commodification of the passive sexual object in the sexual ethics that run from the beginning to the end of the Bible. None of that is relevant anymore. Unfortunately, there are still an awful lot of people who have latched on dogmatically to outdated, obsolete, and irrelevant ideas about sexual ethics, not because they need to, because they don't. They've already rejected a bunch of the Bible's sexual ethics. It's because it's useful for their group, for their group's structuring of power and boundaries and values. And unfortunately, that is hurting an awful lot of people around the world. So if you cannot grapple competently, thoughtfully, critically with these complexities of the Bible's sexual ethics, and if you just immediately retreat to defending and rationalizing your received dogmas about what is appropriate and inappropriate sex, then it's very clear that what's most important to you is not what the Bible says. What's most important to you is how the Bible can be useful to you and your group's identity politics. And that's a problem. And the fit for this video has been my data over dogma hoodie.
