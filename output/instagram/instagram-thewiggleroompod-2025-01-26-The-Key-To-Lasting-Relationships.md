# Full Transcription

~[Female Speaker]~: The privilege of being in relationship with another human being starts with oneself and emanates out from yourself to the other. You got to have someone over there that's committed to letting you figure yourself out. You got to have someone over there who's committed, not, I mean, my husband has not been in love with me every moment of the 42 years we've been married. That is for sure, right? But he is a committed, willing participant, and we've both recognized the value of walking through life together and who we are for each other and having eyes on each other and really appreciating the space we give each other to figure it out because, you know, we're going to die unresolved. In case anybody hasn't told you, you're going to die unresolved. And so, best to get on the path as soon as you can, really loving who you're becoming because that's what matters, who you're becoming, not who you were, but who you're becoming.


~[Male Speaker]~: And your partner has to be able to see that, right?


~[Female Speaker]~: Your partner better be on the same path also, that they also love who they're becoming.


~[Male Speaker]~: Yeah, I think that theory is what essentially creates safety in relationships.
