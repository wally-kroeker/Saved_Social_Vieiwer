# Full Transcription

~Annika~: Can magnesium impact your ADHD? Part two. I'm Annika, I'm an ADHD nutrition research specialist, so follow along if you want to learn more. So, once tyrosine, which is an amino acid that we get through protein, crosses the blood brain barrier, it turns into dopamine. To do this, it needs to turn into L-dopa, and to do that, it uses an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase and it binds it with something called BH4. Now, magnesium increases the affinity that tyrosine hydroxylase has for BH4. Really, what this means is that when we don't have enough magnesium, our production of dopamine can be impaired. Now, considering that most people with ADHD are deficient in magnesium, it's a no-brainer to start focusing on your dietary magnesium. So, some foods that are high in magnesium are dark green veggies, beans, quinoa, and then also chocolate.
