# Full Transcription

~Ta2Queen~: So, this is really interesting. Red Note decided to serve me a number of videos in a row of some of the supporters at the inauguration.
~Ta2Queen~: And this particular video is playing that song, "I took the drugs and the drugs are working," and Elon Musk looks absolutely out of his mind on something.
~Ta2Queen~: And then, a few videos later, footage of Jeff Bezos, also at the inauguration, looking spun out of his mind.
~Ta2Queen~: As someone with a history of recreational stimulant use, I can tell you, these guys are not behaving normally.
~Ta2Queen~: I wish I could find the video that I saw several months ago, but I remember seeing one of Ben Shapiro in a similar state.
~Ta2Queen~: He was giving some sort of rebuttal for a political issue, and I remember thinking, wow, this guy is so stimulated right now, he can barely open his jaw.
~Ta2Queen~: I think that all of these men, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, the rest of them, are having to operate on high amounts of stimulants.
~Ta2Queen~: And it's fascinating to me how white supremacy always seems to produce this result to need to go on and on and on as hard as you can.
~Ta2Queen~: We all know what political figure was very famous for giving hours-long speeches under the influence of methamphetamine.
~Ta2Queen~: White supremacy and fascism don't allow softness and imperfection.
~Ta2Queen~: They don't allow humanity and they don't allow rest.
~Ta2Queen~: White supremacy and fascism require that people overcome all weakness and project only strength.
~Ta2Queen~: And project only energy, and project only smarts.
~Ta2Queen~: And so you cannot be seen making mistakes.
~Ta2Queen~: You cannot be seen being without energy or your brain not functioning too well one of these days.
~Ta2Queen~: And so these people take stimulants to force themselves.
~Ta2Queen~: And nobody's body can operate on that.
~Ta2Queen~: Everybody suffers from this system, even the guys that are at the very top.
~Ta2Queen~: And it is just so fascinating to me how history repeats itself.
~Ta2Queen~: It does not care what your demographics are.
~Ta2Queen~: Ben Shapiro is Jewish.
~Ta2Queen~: So, y'all go and find that footage from the inauguration.
~Ta2Queen~: It's wild.
