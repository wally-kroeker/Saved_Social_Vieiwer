# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: consciousness, it's creating a model of the interests of the organism. And it realizes that the purpose of the exercise is to navigate the organism in the world. And then at some point, it identifies as the organism. And we see this in children typically happening between two and a half and five years old, that they talk about themselves in the first person. Before that, the kid can already talk and they talk about themselves in the third person. So we are basically created by our consciousness, by our infant baby consciousness and then put into this world, in the simulation world that our mind is creating. And then we forget that we created this world in our own mind and identify as this human being that is in this world and is subjected to it. And at some point, we can start meditating and then wake up from this again and realize, oh my God, I'm actually not that self. The self is just a model of a person that doesn't actually exist. It's a story that my mind is telling itself and I'm actually the universe, I'm everything. And then you wake up a little bit more and you realize, oh no, I'm actually the thing that generates it all. I am the generator of everything that I'm interacting with or that makes sense to me.
