# Meeting Description

Okay, here's a consolidated and cleaned-up description based on the provided information, treating it as a recorded monologue rather than a traditional meeting:

**1. Participants:**

*   There is only one participant: a woman recording herself.

**2. Description of the Participant:**

*   **Appearance:** A blonde woman.
*   **Emotional State:** Thoughtful, questioning, and slightly assertive at times as she explains her reasoning. She presents herself as articulate and reflective.
*   **Function/Role:** The speaker is presenting her personal philosophical views, likely to a general audience (e.g., vlog viewers or podcast listeners). She's acting as a solo presenter/commentator.

**3. What Was Discussed/Covered:**

The woman discussed her personal reasons for leaning towards atheism over theism (likely the intended word, correcting the typo "atheism over atheism"). The core topics included:

*   **Atheism vs. Agnosticism:** She clarifies her understanding of atheism, emphasizing that it's not a claim of absolute certainty about God's non-existence, but rather a lack of belief in the specific God(s) presented by theistic religions.
*   **Historical and Psychological Reasoning:** She bases her atheism on observations of human history and psychology, particularly the tendency towards superstition and the creation of religious beliefs. She uses the analogy of childhood fears (like something "under the bed") to illustrate how strongly held beliefs can be unfounded.
*   **Spiritual Atheism:** She distinguishes between atheism (lack of belief in a theistic God) and spirituality. She believes spirituality, defined as a sense of connection, awe, and community, can exist independently of religious beliefs or claims about ultimate reality.
*   **Uncertainty vs. Certainty of Others:** She touches upon the contrast between her own uncertainty and the strong certainty expressed by many religious believers. She questions how billions of people can be so sure of their beliefs, even when those beliefs differ significantly.

**4. Additional Information (Nature of the Recording):**

This is not a traditional meeting but rather a self-recorded monologue, likely intended for a vlog, podcast, or similar platform. The setting is informal â€“ the woman is in the driver's seat of her car, suggesting a spontaneous or semi-structured recording. The overlaid text on the video reinforces her spoken points, acting as visual aids for her explanation. The overall tone is personal, reflective, and aimed at explaining a nuanced philosophical position in a relatable way.

*   **Overall Tone:** The video seems to be a personal reflection on faith and doubt, presented in an informal and relatable way.



# Full Transcription

~Woman~: Why do I lean towards atheism over agnosticism?
~Woman~: It's very interesting in the culture how atheism has become something like having faith that there is no God, and agnosticism being like, I don't know, when that's not really how those terms are used philosophically.
~Woman~: If you have looked at the God of theism, the God of Abrahamic religions, the God of the Bible, and you are not convinced, you are technically an atheist.
~Woman~: Agnosticism is answering a different question entirely, which is, do we have enough information to be even asking this question?
~Woman~: The question that atheism is answering to is an ontological question.
It's a question of what is.
~Woman~: Agnosticism is dealing with epistemology.
It's an entirely different question based on how do we know what we know?
~Woman~: And I get that labels are limiting, but they're also useful when you're trying to explain your worldview to someone else.
~Woman~: So the reason that I lean towards saying I'm an atheist is not because I have looked into the universe and I'm sure that there is no God.
~Woman~: Atheism makes no positive claims about the nature of ultimate reality.
~Woman~: The reason I lean towards saying I'm an atheist is because millions of times in human history, when I've, you know, done my studies in religious history, millions of times, we heard something under the bed and we said there's a monster under the bed.
And then when we looked, there was actually a natural explanation that wasn't a monster under the bed.
~Woman~: So now when people say to me, is there a monster under the bed?
It's not that I know that there's not.
It's that a million times beforehand when we do this as superstitious creatures, and we've looked to see if it's a monster, it wasn't a monster.
So based on what I know about human biases, human superstition, why we create religion, I'm more willing to say that I I'm not convinced of the God of theism.
~Woman~: But that says nothing else about me.
That doesn't mean I'm a materialist.
It doesn't mean that I know what ultimate reality is.
It doesn't mean that I'm militant.
It really means nothing else except I'm not convinced that it's a monster under that bed.
~Woman~: And the reason that I think this is the most humble response is because for at least tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of years, we've been throwing virgins in volcanoes and worshiping gods to try to make sense of things.
~Woman~: So even if you believe that you have the truth and your spiritual experiences point to some specific God, you have to believe then that billions of people who were just as sure of as you are wrong.
~Woman~: And for me, that's when you have to take a step back and say, maybe we're maybe we're bad at this game.
~Woman~: Maybe we're a little too quick to superstition.
~Woman~: Even Richard Rohr, who's a Christian mystic and doing about as beautiful a thing that you can do with Christianity as you can do, when he's asked, what are you going to ask God when you meet God face to face?
And he's going to ask God, why did you make us so superstitious?
It just seems to be so problematic.
That is literally his doubt.
~Woman~: So me saying an atheist, it it's not saying that I'm prideful, it's not saying I'm materialistic, it's not saying that I know that there's no God.
It's not even me discounting all spiritual experience.
It's just me saying, I'm not sure that that's because of a theistic God.
There's a lot of problems with that theory and everyone seems sure of all of their gods and their aliens and whatever the hell they believe, maybe we need to take a step back here.
That's all I'm saying with my atheism.
~Woman~: And yes, I do think you can be a spiritual atheist because spirituality is about connection, awe, transcendence, community, ritual, contemplation.
I can have all those things without it being dependent on truth claims about ultimate reality that I just don't know.
