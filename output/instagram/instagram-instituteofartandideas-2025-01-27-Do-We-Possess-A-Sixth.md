# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Also got this theory that when you encounter any kind of art, music, writing, painting, movies, anything, I think you sense it when you're excited about it at a level that is not from the five senses. You think you've ingested it at the level of the five senses, ear, sight, whatever. But you actually the response mechanism is something other. And it's it's like the sixth sense that that is kind of got this gets the hit from it and perhaps the same aspect that gives the inspiration to make work, which is so intrinsic to be being human, the creative urge, the resourceful thought that may or may not work.
