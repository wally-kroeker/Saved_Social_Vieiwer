# Process Saved Links Documentation

Welcome to the Process Saved Links documentation. This project automates the downloading, processing, and organization of content from social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram.

## Simplified Documentation

To understand the project quickly, refer to these two primary documents:

1. [Project Overview](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) - What the project does and technologies used
2. [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) - Current status, roadmap, and how to contribute

These documents provide all the essential information to get started with the project.

## Archived Documentation

All legacy documentation has been moved to the `/archive` directory for reference. This includes:

- Previous project overview documents
- Detailed implementation guides
- Integration specifications
- Development setup guides
- Reference documentation

New contributors should focus on the simplified documentation files first. The archived documentation may contain outdated information but is preserved for historical reference.

## Documentation Status

We've completed the consolidation of our documentation to make it more accessible and maintainable. The project now has:

1. Two primary documentation files that contain all essential information
2. An archive of historical documentation for reference when needed

If you find any inconsistencies or have questions, please refer to the primary documents or contact the project maintainers.
