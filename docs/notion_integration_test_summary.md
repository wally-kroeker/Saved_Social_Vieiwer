# Notion Integration Testing Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the testing process and results for the Notion integration module of the Process Saved Links project.

## Testing Process
1. Retrieved actual Notion API credentials from the existing script
2. Updated the `.env` file with the actual credentials
3. Modified the Notion integration module to align with the property names used in the existing script
4. Created an automated test script that verifies:
   - Connection to the Notion API
   - Retrieval of unprocessed links
   - Marking links as processed

## Test Results
- **API Connection**: Successfully connected to the Notion API using the actual credentials
- **Retrieving Unprocessed Links**: Successfully retrieved 5 unprocessed links from the database
- **Marking as Processed**: Successfully marked a link as processed in the database

## Key Adjustments Made
1. Updated property names in the Notion integration module:
   - Changed status values from "Completed" to "Done" to match the existing script
   - Used "Name" property for the title instead of a separate metadata property
   - Simplified the metadata storage approach

2. Modified the test script:
   - Removed references to non-existent properties
   - Automated the testing process by removing interactive prompts
   - Added appropriate test data for marking items as processed

## Conclusion
The Notion integration module is now fully functional and tested with actual API credentials. It successfully integrates with the existing Notion database and can be used as part of the Process Saved Links project.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the output manager module
2. Begin refactoring the Instagram processor
3. Integrate the Notion module with the main scheduler
