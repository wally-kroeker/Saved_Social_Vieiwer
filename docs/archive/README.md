# Documentation Archive

This directory contains legacy documentation for the Process Saved Links project. These files have been archived as part of our documentation simplification initiative.

## Why This Archive Exists

As the project evolved, we decided to consolidate our documentation into two primary files:
1. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - Project purpose and technical overview
2. DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md - Development instructions and roadmap

This archive preserves the detailed historical documentation for reference purposes.

## Archive Contents

- `overview/` - Original high-level project information
- `development/` - Original development setup and guidelines

## Using Archived Documentation

While these documents may contain outdated information, they might be useful for:
- Understanding the historical development of the project
- Finding detailed technical information not included in the simplified docs
- Referencing specific implementation decisions

**Note:** For current project information, always refer to the primary documentation files in the parent directory.
