# Process Saved Links: Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to refactor and enhance the existing Instagram link processing system to create a unified solution for processing saved social media links from various platforms. The new system will be modular, extensible, and automated to run at scheduled intervals.

## Goals and Objectives

1. Create a modular architecture for processing social media links
2. Refactor existing Instagram processing functionality
3. Add support for YouTube video processing
4. Implement automated scheduling (3 times daily)
5. Design a template system for adding new platforms
6. Ensure consistent output format across platforms

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Refactoring (1-2 days)

#### Tasks:
1. **Create Project Structure**
   - Set up directory structure according to the system patterns
   - Create base files and modules
   - Implement configuration management

2. **Implement Core Components**
   - Create the Notion integration module
   - Implement the output manager
   - Set up the base processor class
   - Create utility modules (logging, file operations)

3. **Refactor Instagram Processing**
   - Move Instagram-specific logic to its own module
   - Adapt existing code to the new architecture
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing scripts
   - Update pause time to 15 minutes between downloads

4. **Testing**
   - Test the refactored Instagram processor
   - Verify output compatibility with the existing viewer

### Phase 2: YouTube Processing (2-3 days)

#### Tasks:
1. **YouTube Download Implementation**
   - Implement YouTube link detection
   - Use yt-dlp to download videos
   - Handle various YouTube URL formats

2. **Audio Processing Integration**
   - Integrate with offmute for audio processing
   - Ensure proper audio extraction and enhancement

3. **Output Generation**
   - Implement MP4 video generation
   - Create thumbnail extraction
   - Generate markdown transcripts
   - Ensure naming convention matches Instagram format

4. **Testing**
   - Test with various YouTube links
   - Verify compatibility with the viewer interface

### Phase 3: Scheduling and Automation (1 day)

#### Tasks:
1. **Scheduler Implementation**
   - Create the core scheduler module
   - Implement the main execution flow
   - Add support for command-line arguments

2. **Automation Setup**
   - Configure cron jobs for scheduled execution
   - Set up morning, noon, and 11:00 PM runs
   - Implement proper logging for unattended execution

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Ensure proper notification of failures

4. **Testing**
   - Test scheduled execution
   - Verify error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation (1-2 days)

#### Tasks:
1. **System Testing**
   - Test the entire system with various links
   - Verify all components work together
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

2. **Documentation**
   - Document the system architecture
   - Create usage instructions
   - Document the process for adding new platforms
   - Update Memory Bank files

3. **Future Platform Template**
   - Create a template for adding new platforms
   - Document the extension process
   - Prepare example for TikTok integration

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Processing videos can be resource-intensive
- 15-minute pause between processing items to avoid rate limiting
- Scheduled runs should not overlap

### Integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing Notion database
- Ensure output format works with the current viewer
- Standardize naming conventions across platforms

### Extensibility
- Design for easy addition of new platforms
- Create clear interfaces for platform processors
- Document extension points

## Timeline

- **Week 1**:
  - Days 1-2: Phase 1 - Project Setup and Refactoring
  - Days 3-5: Phase 2 - YouTube Processing

- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1: Phase 3 - Scheduling and Automation
  - Days 2-3: Phase 4 - Testing and Documentation

## Success Criteria

1. System successfully processes both Instagram and YouTube links
2. Output is compatible with the existing viewer
3. System runs automatically at scheduled times
4. Documentation is complete and clear
5. Architecture allows for easy addition of new platforms

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API changes in external services | High | Medium | Design with abstraction layers to isolate external dependencies |
| Resource constraints during video processing | Medium | High | Implement proper resource management and timeouts |
| Scheduling conflicts | Medium | Low | Add checks to prevent overlapping runs |
| Output format incompatibility | High | Medium | Thoroughly test with existing viewer before deployment |

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the project plan
2. Set up the project structure
3. Begin implementation of Phase 1
