# Process Saved Links: Product Requirements Document

## Project Purpose

Process Saved Links is a tool designed to automate the workflow of downloading, processing, and organizing content from various social media platforms. It addresses the need to save interesting content from platforms like Instagram and YouTube for later reference, research, or archival purposes, eliminating the manual labor of downloading and organizing this content.

## Problem Statement

Content creators, researchers, and casual users often save links to valuable content across multiple platforms but face several challenges:
- Content may become unavailable over time (deleted or made private)
- Manual downloading is time-consuming
- Organizing content from different platforms is inconsistent
- Accessing saved content offline requires planning

This project solves these problems by providing an automated system to process saved links, download the content, generate additional resources like transcripts, and organize everything in a standardized format for easy access.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Platform Support**
   - Must support YouTube videos
   - Must support Instagram posts (images, videos, and stories)
   - Should be extensible to other platforms in the future

2. **Content Processing**
   - Must download videos/images from supported platforms
   - Must generate transcripts for video content
   - Must extract and store metadata (author, title, date, etc.)
   - Must organize content in a standardized file structure

3. **Integration**
   - Must integrate with Notion as a database for tracking links and their processing status
   - Must provide status updates for processed content

4. **Content Access**
   - Must include a content viewer for browsing and accessing processed content
   - Should support basic search/filtering capabilities

5. **Automation**
   - Must support batch processing
   - Should support continuous processing mode
   - Should handle rate limiting appropriately

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Should process content in a reasonable time frame
   - Should support parallel processing when possible

2. **Reliability**
   - Must handle network errors gracefully
   - Must retry failed downloads or processing
   - Must not lose data during processing

3. **Usability**
   - Must provide clear feedback on processing status
   - Should offer a user-friendly command-line interface
   - Should include comprehensive documentation

4. **Security**
   - Must handle API tokens securely
   - Should not expose sensitive information in logs

## Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful if it:
1. Reliably processes 90%+ of valid links without manual intervention
2. Reduces the time spent on manual content saving by at least 80%
3. Provides organized, standardized output for all processed content
4. Maintains a clean, accessible archive of content that would otherwise be scattered or lost

## User Personas

1. **Content Curator**
   - Regularly saves videos and posts for inspiration
   - Needs to reference content offline
   - Values organization and easy access

2. **Researcher**
   - Collects content for analysis
   - Needs transcripts and metadata
   - Values completeness and accuracy

3. **Content Creator**
   - Saves content for reference and inspiration
   - Needs to find saved content quickly
   - Values efficient workflows

## Future Scope

While not part of the initial requirements, these features may be considered for future versions:
- Support for additional platforms (Twitter, TikTok, etc.)
- Advanced content tagging and categorization
- AI-based content summarization
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Mobile-friendly content access
- Content recommendation based on saved items
