# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: Here's an Instagram story you can post today to get a sale or a client today. This is really helpful. I like wrote all the the steps down. Step one, open your Instagram app and go to your IG story section. So go to your IG stories. Step two, I want you to film a 15-second video of your face and I want you to use this exact script. I'm just going to read it. Use it exactly. In case you don't know, I help X with Y. Is this something you need help with? And then vote below. So you're going to like basically say that exact script. Then you're going to before you're going to publish a story, you're going to make a poll on your story that has two options. Yes, with an exclamation point. And then the second option is not right now, but thanks. Then you're going to step four, publish the Instagram story. You're going to send a DM to everyone who votes yes and close one in five poll votes. I teach my students to this all the time and it works super well, so you're welcome.
