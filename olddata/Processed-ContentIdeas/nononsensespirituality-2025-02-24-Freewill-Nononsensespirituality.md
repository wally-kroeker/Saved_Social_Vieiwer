**1. Participants:**

*   There is only one participant: an unnamed woman.

**2. Description of the Participant:**

*   **Appearance:** The woman has blonde hair and is wearing a light blue hoodie.
*   **Setting:** She is sitting in the driver's seat of a car, indicating this is not a formal meeting setting.
*   **Emotional State:** She appears engaged, animated, and somewhat emphatic in her explanation. Her expressions suggest she's conveying a point with conviction, possibly with a hint of frustration or emphasis. She is introspective and self-aware.

**3. What Was Discussed/Covered:**

*   **Main Topic: Free Will:** The core discussion revolves around the philosophical concept of free will. The woman shares her personal perspective, arguing *against* the existence of free will in her own life, at least on this particular day.
*   **Personal Example: Gym Attendance:** She uses the example of her decision-making process regarding going to the gym (or not going) to illustrate her point. She attributes her actions to a series of "inputs" rather than free choice.

# Full Transcription

~Woman~: Let me explain how I didn't have free will today.
~Woman~: I wrote on my to-do list, go to the gym.
~Woman~: I did not go to the gym.
~Woman~: So what do I do with that as someone who doesn't believe that I have free will?
~Woman~: I actually try to notice the inputs into the system that is me, that made it so I didn't go to the gym today when on most Mondays I usually do.
~Woman~: And if I'm thinking about all the inputs, well I only got like four hours of sleep last night.
~Woman~: And I'm jet lagged.
~Woman~: And I usually have my teenager work out with me after I pick him up from the bus, but I don't have to do that today, so I didn't have a partner.
~Woman~: So what I then do is say, what are the inputs that I'm going to need tomorrow to make sure that I get to the gym tomorrow?
~Woman~: And I start to make those changes.
~Woman~: And this is where people will say, well that part is free will.
~Woman~: But that's not free will either, because I didn't choose to become the kind of person who would want to lift weights.
~Woman~: I have a mom who's a professional weightlifter and I see how much healthy she is as a woman of her age because she weightlifts.
~Woman~: I also spend time on Instagram where everyone tells me that apparently weightlifting is very good for you.
~Woman~: And when I'm at the gym lifting weights and I listen to a podcast that I've been wanting to listen to, I feel better afterwards.
~Woman~: I didn't choose any of those inputs either.
~Woman~: So essentially, what it's like to not have free will is to see yourself as a system of inputs.
~Woman~: And that's good news because then I can work with this system so that the output is something that this meat suit that I am likes.
~Woman~: And if you started with the Big Bang and you accounted for randomness, I would always end up here talking about free will because I find it interesting for no other reason than this meat suit finds free will conversations interesting, and you would be here not having scrolled past this video because for some reason your meat suit finds it interesting too.
~Woman~: Not having free will doesn't mean you just like stop, like, oh, I'll just stop now, I have no choice.
~Woman~: It actually means you can learn how to work with it to your advantage.
~Woman~: So hopefully, at this time tomorrow, I'll be at the gym.
~Woman~: But today because of various factors, I didn't make it.
~Woman~: Believing that I had free will actually kept me more trapped in my patterns.
~Woman~: Not believing I have free will actually helped me to work with the system that I am towards wherever this thing wants to go.
