# Full Transcription

~Sabrina Ramonov~: Every month I like to reflect on the biggest challenges I have as an AI solopreneur building blotato.com. And this month my top three challenges, I would say number one is just figuring out how to deploy my resources effectively, including money and time. Um, I'm already supporting the product, building the product, fixing bugs, uh, doing marketing, but I want to be able to scale marketing as well, not just using my own brand all the time. Uh, but it's really hard actually to find good creators and clippers and video editors to work with. So if you are one, then hit me up, send me a DM. Number two is it's pretty hard to keep all my product help docs up to date and continually improve my AI support agents. My goal is to get its resolution rate above 95%, but that requires clean data that requires like my help docs actually being accurate, but I'm pushing changes all the time to the product, which requires me to go back and update my help docs all the time. Number three is it's so tempting for me to continually build the next new shiny feature because it's really fun to do that and it's fun to showcase it as well. I know rationally it's way more important to keep improving the heart of the product, the foundation of the product. So things like scheduling and the calendar, I know I need to massively improve it, but I'm not excited to work on it because it's not a shiny new object. I'm not sure these three challenges will ever go away though. At every stage, I feel like it's always some form of these three challenges.
