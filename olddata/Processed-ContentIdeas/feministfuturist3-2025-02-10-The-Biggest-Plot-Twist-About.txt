The Biggest Plot Twist About Men No One Talks About… 🤯

Ever wondered why some men seem to want women but don’t actually like them? Turns out, the way boys are raised plays a huge role. Society doesn’t teach them how to be men, it just teaches them not to be like women. 💡

❌ "Don't cry, be a man."
❌ "Don't be weak, be a man."
❌ "Don't like that, it's for girls."

And the weapon of choice? Shame.
They’re taught that being feminine is the worst thing ever. But at the same time, their status is measured by their ability to attract women. See the contradiction? 🧐

No wonder so many women feel unseen, unheard, and undervalued. Maybe it's time to start asking: Do they truly like women, or just what women can do for them?

Let’s talk. 👇✨
