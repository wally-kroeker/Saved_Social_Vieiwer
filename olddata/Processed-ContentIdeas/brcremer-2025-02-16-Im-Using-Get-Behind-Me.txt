I’m using “get behind me Satan” here in the same thing way Jesus did when he said it to Peter in Mark 8:33 and Matthew 16:23.

Jesus predicted his own death and resurrection. But Peter like many was waiting for a military “strongman” messiah to overthrow Rome because that’s how he believed God would bring salvation to Israel. So Peter rebuked Jesus for daring to say he was going to die for everyone instead, even his enemies. Peter rebuked Jesus because you can’t overthrow Rome with a dead messiah.

Then Jesus said to Peter “get behind me Satan” to because Peter was tempting him with dominating others through political power in the same Satan had tempted him in the wilderness with power over all the earthly kingdoms. So Jesus rebuked him for acting that way and “for having the ways of the world” on his mind, rather than “the ways of God.”

I’m using that phrase in the same way towards the same kind of thinking within Christianity today.

“For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine and accurate instruction [that challenges them with God’s truth]; but wanting to have their ears tickled [with something pleasing], they will accumulate for themselves [many] teachers [one after another, chosen] to satisfy their own desires and to support the errors they hold” -2 Timothy 4:3-4
