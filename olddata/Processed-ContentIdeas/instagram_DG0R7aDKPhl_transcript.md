# Full Transcription

~Ro Moëd~: It's commonly said that you should put your partner first. And while I absolutely agree that our partners should be a priority for us and we should care about them and be mindful of the impact that we're having on them, I think this phrase originated in a society where the goal of relationships was to make them last. So if your goal in a relationship is simply to make it last, then self-sacrifice, avoidance of conflict, and enabling are all great tools to get you there. If your goal in a relationship, however, is not simply to make it last, but to make it good, to make it a space where you can grow and become more of yourself and feel happier, simply doing whatever your partner asks of you, whether it's self-sacrificial or not, is not going to get you there. So then when it comes to handling jealousy, what do you do? What is the loving thing to do for both yourself and the other person? In a traditional relationship, the norm is, your partner feels jealous, you change your behavior to stop them feeling that way. But in a relationship where you're trying to become more of yourselves and you're trying to grow, challenging that may be necessary. Sometimes it may be tolerable for you to make some accommodations, and that's up to you to decide what the limits are for you personally. But just changing your behavior, abandoning relationships so that your partner doesn't feel jealous, that's not really a long-term solution. Some people are understandably, I guess, so frustrated by the oppressive expectation that if your partner feels jealous, you just do whatever it takes to stop them having a negative feeling, that they've swung all the way to the other end of the spectrum and are now saying stuff like, well, if you feel jealous, that's none of my business. I still think there's a loving way to handle jealousy as a team, but it's not going to be, okay, well, this thing upset you, so I just won't do it anymore even if it upsets me not to do it. It's good to examine these feelings and where they come from and whether by having them and letting them be there for a while, we might be able to work with them, become more resilient to them, and feel a little bit more secure in the world. If your partner said to you, you know what, it makes me really uncomfortable every time you go outside, I'd rather you didn't do it. We of course would not say, okay, I guess I'm just an inside person then now because I put you first and if it makes you uncomfortable, I just I just won't go outside. We normalize asking people to give up relationships. And I think non-monogamy what it's doing for the world is undoing that.
