# Full Transcription

~Cory Muscara~: Here's a question to assess if your behavior is rooted in codependence. Is this action inspired by my love for this person, or is it an attempt to get love from this person?
~Cory Muscara~: When you do something out of love for another person, you are coming from the place in you that feels full and whole, making your actions a true form of generosity without any hooks.
~Cory Muscara~: But when you do something in an attempt to get love from another person, you are coming from the place in you that feels empty, which can lead to resentment if you don't get the response you want.
~Cory Muscara~: Remember, the root of codependency is, I need you to be this way in order for me to feel okay.
~Cory Muscara~: If you're not aware of this tendency, you'll try to control someone into being the person who fills the void that you aren't yet able to fill yourself.
~Cory Muscara~: But if you are conscious of this pattern, you can be honest about what you need, ask for reassurance when you feel vulnerable, and share your feelings without blaming the other person for them.
~Cory Muscara~: Then your relationship can become a source of healing.
~Cory Muscara~: It's okay to want love from another person. The key is to be aware of where your actions are coming from, so you don't get caught in subconscious patterns of emotional manipulation.
