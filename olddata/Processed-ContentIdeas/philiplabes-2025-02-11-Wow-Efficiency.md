# Full Transcription

~Singer~: 300 babies born with disease, needlessly sick for the rest of their lives. That's efficiency. Here are the bad guys who can't explain why. Put them in prison camps, better yet kill them. That's efficiency. This is nothing like history. Well, here is a world with no schools, no support, just economy. My God. Wow. The efficiency.

Get rid of the roads, get rid of cheap goods, get rid of Medicare, get rid of the woods. Keep the billionaire tax breaks, slave labor jails. Let's get rid of the pesky arts budget we spent, cause it's almost a hundredth of one whole percent. We'll keep the defense and get rid of the mail.

Well, here is a world with no schools, no support, just economy. My God. Wow. The efficiency. We can get more efficient. Give jobs to the tykes. Get children in factories, kill any that strike. Have a modest proposal, I think that you'll like.

We've got tools that can automate this with a quick. Adults over 70, straight in the pit. Impregnate the women, abandon the sick. What's unknown, hard to grasp, incomplete. That's a line item we can delete. No choice, aberration, deviation, confusing variety. Ooh. My God. The majestic efficiency. Wow. The efficiency. I love the efficiency.

Come back tomorrow or follow me for the next song.
