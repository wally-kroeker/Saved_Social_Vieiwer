# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: I just wanted to let you know that the boycotts are working.
~Speaker 1~: Intuitively, I'm picking up on some vibes that the owners of capital are shitting bricks.
~Speaker 1~: People are not out spending money like they should be, and they don't know what to do about it because if they say that out loud, they will embolden us to do more.
~Speaker 1~: This is a really similar vibe that I was picking up about taxes last year.
~Speaker 1~: I got this intuition that was like, oh wow, there is really low tax compliance.
~Speaker 1~: And they are looking at their ledgers, like the population and how many tax returns they should be getting, and they can tell by the difference that a lot of people just aren't filing tax returns.
~Speaker 1~: And they don't know what to do about that either, because if they tell us, hey, y'all better pay your taxes, not enough people are paying, then we'll go, oh, people aren't paying their taxes, then I'm going to do it too because I'll get away with it.
~Speaker 1~: They literally don't know how to make us stop boycotting.
~Speaker 1~: They already have applied every tactic they have to make us spend money because they are constantly making us spend money out of necessity.
~Speaker 1~: And now we are applying conscious choice and we are choosing to spend our money wisely and vote on the things and the companies that are behaving in human interest rather than capital interest.
~Speaker 1~: And it's going to take a while for that to show in the stock market.
~Speaker 1~: I think that we will have to boycott for at least one financial quarter so that when they report quarterly earnings, it actually shows a downswing.
~Speaker 1~: I think that we could also speed this up by just selling any stock we have in those companies that we do not support.
~Speaker 1~: Target is absolutely cooked.
~Speaker 1~: I felt within one week of the boycott starting that Target would file for bankruptcy.
~Speaker 1~: I don't feel any other companies filing for bankruptcy in the energy currently, but I do feel in the energy that Amazon will be having union problems this year.
~Speaker 1~: There's going to be workers organizing and striking.
~Speaker 1~: I also think that we will see a general strike.
~Speaker 1~: So that's just a little bit of an update on the financial reality.
~Speaker 1~: Keep it going, y'all.
~Speaker 1~: You're doing really well.
~Speaker 1~: You are managing to scare rich people.
