  "title": "Sean Clayton on Instagram: \"Check my stories to go deeper into this truth.\n\nWhat if Yeshua wasn’t crucified for claiming to be the Son of God, but for revealing that we all are? What if his teachings weren’t about worship, but awakening?\n\n“To you, it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom...” — Luke 8:10\n\nThe secrets weren’t just words—they were power. A direct path to the divine that bypassed temples, priests, and control. To the elite, he was a threat. To Rome, a disruption. To those guarding divine knowledge, he was dangerous.\n\nSo his story was rewritten. The mystics who remembered? Erased.\n\n✨ But truth cannot be erased.\n✨ The remembering has begun.\n\nThank you, and I love you. ❤️\"",
