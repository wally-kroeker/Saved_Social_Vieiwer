# Full Transcription

~Singer-songwriter~: Sometimes my brain's a bully.
Sometimes it says really mean things.
Sometimes about myself, sometimes somebody else, but my brain don't know everything.
'Cause I am not my thoughts.
And I choose to listen to my heart.

Sometimes my brain's a bully.
Sometimes that voice is not my own.
Might be something that I've heard, maybe someone else's words, but I can always tell the voice, no.
I am not my thoughts.
And I choose to listen to my heart.
