When I run into her real page I will tag her page. When I don’t have tag sometime it’s because I found the video on a page with random videos with no knowledge of who they are. When u get to that point of knowing its a test. Man U cant be stopped. You become so powerful. Don’t nothing faze u because i have a destiny to fulfill. I cant keep going backwards with negative, dark energies. I see everything as a test. I remember couple of years ago i prayed to God to control my emotions and i can say today. They have been answered. When u know in the spirit realm what u up against. U would know where, what and who the attacks are from. I dont see me as strong cussing someone out. I see a weak me if i cuss someone out. I honestly do. It takes strength to see the spirit behind that person. To know how to react. Sometimes no reaction is a win. Block and keep living ur life like it’s golden if u know who u are and see it spiritually.
