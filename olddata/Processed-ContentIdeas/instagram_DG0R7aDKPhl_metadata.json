  "title": "Ro MoÃ«d on Instagram: \"How do we handle jealousy lovingly?\n\nSometimes, it is loving to challenge ourselves and others. When we normalise self-sacrifice to avoid conflict, we relate to others inauthentically, we injure our self-trust, and we rob everyone of the chance to face difficulties, overcome them and grow from them.\n\nIf you curious to learn more about how we can lovingly handle jealousy, Iâ€™ll be releasing tickets for my new talk soon, âœ¨Jealousy Management: Befriend the Green-Eyed Monster âœ¨\n\nDrawing on Transactional Analysis, polyvagal theory, and attachment theory, weâ€™ll explore the psychological, physiological, and relational roots of jealousy. Together, weâ€™ll unpack how social conditioning and identity goals play a part in our experiences, and explore practical tools to turn that knowledge into change.\n\nKeep an eye on my stories not to miss out ðŸ«¶ hope to see you there!\n\nUnapolygetically,\n\nRo \n\nðŸ¤— I offer individual and couples coaching for people wanting to face challenges in their relationships lovingly, and bravely ðŸ”—\n\n#jealousy #jealous #jealouspeople #polyamory #polyamorous #polyamorousrelationship #relationshipcoaching #relationshipcoach #relationshipanarchy\"",
