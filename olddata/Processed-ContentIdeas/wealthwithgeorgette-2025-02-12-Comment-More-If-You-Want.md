# Full Transcription

~Jaja~: Can we stop gatekeeping this, please? Because this is by far the fastest, most beginner-friendly way to earn 5 to 10k a month legally from your phone. And don't worry, it's not going to be saturated because there's literally millions of products that you can choose from. And actually, most people in this world have the mindset of the only way that you can earn good money is by going to college, going to university and getting a good job and clocking in every day. If you're not one of those people, then hi, I'm Jaja. I've made over 70k online promoting other company's digital products and now I help other people do the same so they can escape the rat race. So you're going to go over to Digistore 24 and you're going to create an account for free. Then head over to marketplace. Over on the left here, you're going to scroll through all the categories. Now you're going to find a product that pays a high commission rate. Next, you're going to head over to pexels.com, which is also free. Type a keyword relating to the product you've chosen and then find an image that relates to the product. Then head over to Pinterest, which is also free. Make sure you have a business account. You can set that up for free and then you're going to click create pin. And here you're going to add your image that you've downloaded. Add a description and then for this part here where it says link, you need to come back to Digistore 24 and then grab that link from here. Here are some of my commissions doing this exact thing.
