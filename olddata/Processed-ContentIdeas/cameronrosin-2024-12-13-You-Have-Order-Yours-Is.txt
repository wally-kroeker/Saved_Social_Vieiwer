You have order.

Yours is the order of clouds that gather and break in space.

Yours is the order of many streams braided into one.

You are Truth Seeker. Wayfinder.

You belong to many worlds. You are the space in which multitudes manifest.

You are witness to a great gathering of Selves. Your path is the sum of their paths.

You are emergent. To stick to one thing is to defy your essential nature. 

Surrender joyously to the wisdom of your heart and you will know your order as that of Creation itself.

Over the coming days I’m releasing a series of Multipotentialite newsletters written to help you harmonise your many interests into a cohesive flow. I know what it’s like to be confused by your own potential and overwhelmed by options. I also know how immensely powerful and satisfying it is to channel your gifts into devotional, reciprocal service to humanity. 

If you haven’t joined my list yet, head to the button upstairs so you don’t miss out. 

Ubuntu. I am because we are. Big love.
