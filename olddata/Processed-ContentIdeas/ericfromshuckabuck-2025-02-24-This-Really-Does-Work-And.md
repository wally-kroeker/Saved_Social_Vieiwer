# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Wish I would have known about this sooner, because now Amazon is actually paying all of our bills, and we're using things like this inversion table to do it. So, let me show you how it works. So, first go to Amazon and find that table, and then just make sure there's a video on the listing. If there is, you can actually get your phone out and make a quick video talking about how that product works, and then upload it to the video section. And then when someone goes to this listing on Amazon, watches your video, and then makes a purchase, you're going to get a commission, just like this person right here earns commissions. I've been doing this with everything in our house, and we're making commissions every single day. And these videos don't need to be long. They're two to three minutes long. You don't have to show your face, and you're not posting them to social media. You're just posting them to Amazon. But the best part is, once you upload your video, you're going to keep getting commissions over and over, because this is bought over 500 times a month. This sounds like something you can do and you want to get started, comment the word "guide" and I'll send you over a quick tutorial that goes through everything.
