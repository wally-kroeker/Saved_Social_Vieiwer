# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: The world we live in today isn't just built on patriarchy. It's built on an imbalance of energy. Masculine energy in its purest form is beautiful. It's strength, logic, action, and protection. But when it's placed above the feminine, above feeling, intuition, and connection, it creates a world out of balance, a world that values power over love, thinking over feeling, domination over harmony. From the time they were children, boys are taught that emotions are weak, that crying makes them less of a man, that logic and control are superior to feeling and flow. They're not taught how to process their emotions, how to sit with discomfort, and how to connect to their hearts. And when emotions are suppressed, they don't disappear. They manifest in other ways, in aggression, in disconnection, and in power struggles. In a world that glorifies war, competition, and success at any cost, this is the end result. This isn't just about men. Women have also been trained to reject their feminine essence. We've been taught to harden ourselves to survive in a world that doesn't honor softness. We've been told to fit into patriarchal structures rather than reshape them. And when both men and women are disconnected from the feminine, we become disconnected from our hearts, our soul, and from the very earth itself. Look at where we are now, a world that prioritizes profit over people, a world that embraces technology without balance, a world that extracts from the earth, from women, from the vulnerable, with no thought of giving back. The exploitation of women as sexual objects is the same mentality that exploits the earth as a resource. Both are seen as things to be used rather than sacred sources of life. And this is what happens when the feminine is stripped of its divinity. But the truth is, this imbalance hurts everyone. Men suffer when they can't express their emotions. Women suffer when they don't honor their wisdom and nurturance. The earth suffers when we lose our connection to it. And humanity suffers when we live in a world that values the mind over the heart, control over connection, and power over love. The way forward isn't about making one energy dominant over the other. It's about restoring harmony. We need the wisdom of the feminine just as we need the strength and the protection of the masculine. We need leadership that is heart-centered, not just power-driven. We need to teach our boys that emotions don't make them weak and teach our girls that wisdom and softness are strengths, not burdens. The physiological fact that we have both left and right brain hemispheres, masculine and feminine energies working together, show that we embody both within us. To restore divine harmony, both men and women must honor and integrate these aspects within ourselves. Only then can this balance be reflected in our external reality in the world. If we want a better world, we have to start within, honoring the feminine within us, honoring the masculine in its highest form, returning to the heart, returning to the earth. This is how we shift. This is how we heal. Comment below and let me know what you think. Peace.
