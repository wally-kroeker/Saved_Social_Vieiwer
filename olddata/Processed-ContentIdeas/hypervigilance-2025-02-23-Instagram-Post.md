# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: what I see as cultural narcissism. And so my take on pathological narcissism is that they remain trapped in what Melanie Klein calls the paranoid schizoid position, which is the earliest kind of form of infant consciousness, right? And so part of that is black and white thinking. An infant sees good or bad with no nuance in between. If you meet the infant's needs, you're good. If you deny the needs, you're bad, right? I this is this is what narcissists are, they're infants. Um and so they they see no in between. You combine that with kind of Christian conditioning of like good and evil and what you have is a bunch of shadow projection. That people that can only see good or bad, that have to identify themselves as good, therefore they project their shadow onto the people around them. And so they have determined Donald Trump is good. And because they see no nuance, he is all good. And because he is good, anybody against him must be bad. this is the level of thinking that's going on. that this is where we're at. They're literal fucking cultural infants. Trupism is cultural narcissism, conservatism is cultural narcissism. The American exceptionalist mythology is the grandiose false self of this cultural narcissism. And so that that's part of the American exceptionalism. If you notice like the American exceptionalist mythology is kind of the patriot mythology that that is a non-critical look at the founding of America, right? And then when we start to kind of let in different cultural perspectives say of the slaves, um they they they they say it makes them hate America. And you see this again where they can't have this cognitive dissonance of both America is the greatest thing ever and and we're totally about freedom and also we're a colony founded on genocide and slavery, right? They they can't sit with the shame that that brings them. And so instead they they they they cling to their delusions and they seek to destroy the thing making them feel shame. They don't feel shame and self-reflect, they feel shame and freak out. And so yeah, it it is fascinating. But this to me this is all about various elements of cultural narcissism that have them trapped in this singular perspective. A narcissist interprets any accurate descriptions of their behavior as attacks because they're defended against reality. They're living in their own distorted version of reality and anything that seeks to penetrate that triggers them. This is what we're dealing with, cultural narcissism, right? and and individual narcissism, the reflection of Donald Trump's malignancy for instance. And how Donald Trump like narcissist see good and bad objects, right? I was talking about the good and the bad and so they split, they go idealize devalue discard. Donald Trump sees the American government, the American legal system and American citizens as a bad object now because we he lost an election, they attempted to put him in jail and everybody's protesting and hating against him. So subconsciously Donald Trump is trying to destroy us and the country. That's what's driving his behavior, the need to destroy this country. He's probably not aware of this. Narcissists are driven by their somatic states. If it feels good to them in real time, it it it's true. If it feels bad to them in real time, it's false with no actual considerations for reality. And so we're we're in a very precarious psychological situation that historically leads to incredibly bad outcomes.
