# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Hang on, do people not know the difference between capitalism and commerce? Why is it whenever you criticize modern day consumer capitalism, you get comments saying stuff like, oh, I bet you weren't criticizing capitalism when you bought that phone in a shop for money. That's called commerce. People have been exchanging goods and services for some type of currency since, hang on, since ancient Mesopotamia, which is roughly 5,000 years ago, which predates capitalism by like four and a half thousand years. Also, there's lots of different ways to do capitalism, right? Criticizing today's system isn't inherently socialist. If you hear somebody criticizing today's economic system and you think that makes them a socialist or a communist, you are not sophisticated enough to participate in this conversation. Please be quiet. There are no economic systems or power structures of any kind that should not be constantly subjected to rigorous scrutiny and criticism. If you think an economic system should be above criticism, that's essentially an economic religion. You have a religious level of dedication to an economic system that you don't understand. You are not sophisticated enough to participate in this conversation. Kindly take a seat.
