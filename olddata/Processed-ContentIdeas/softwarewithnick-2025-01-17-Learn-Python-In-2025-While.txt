Learn Python in 2025 while gaming 🐍

Finding the time to learn Python can be difficult. Luckily there’s ways to learn Python and play games at the same time! The “joy of programming” game will let you write REAL Python code while completing objectives in the game!

This game is probably my favorite coding game I’ve tried so far, so make sure you at least look into it. Learning to code doesn’t have to be as painful as watching YouTube videos on repeat, make sure to try some other methods!
