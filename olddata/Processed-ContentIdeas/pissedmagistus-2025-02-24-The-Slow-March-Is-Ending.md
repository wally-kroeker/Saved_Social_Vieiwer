# Full Transcription

~Rally Leader~: We're not going to quit. Fight, fight, fight!

~Speaker 2~: Yeah, I'm not going to lie. The soft launch of the new neo-Nazi America style nationalist movement 2025 was definitely on my bingo card. This is incredibly predictable. They're going to keep doing this and other things like this, and they're going to keep downplaying it in the media. What? That was just a wave. It was just me giving my heart away. Why are you being so emotional? Why are you being so dramatic? They do this because they understand that a big portion of their following really enjoy how upset inflammatory rhetoric and symbolic gestures make people. It makes them feel superior to laugh at the melodrama, at the overreaction. This is just a hand gesture. You're acting like the world is over. You're being so dramatic. It makes them feel like they're the sensible one. They're the reasonable one for normalizing this kind of behavior. The thing is, the more you normalize it, the more you create a safe space for the people that aren't joking, that really mean it, right? That actually believe the ideas that go hand in hand with what this symbolic gesture symbolizes. Now, that allows the political and the financial elites to mobilize the most militant, the most aggressive, and the most radical, and once mobilized, the most unquestioningly loyal subsegments of the population on their own behalf without any significant pushback, making more space for this kind of militant ideology in the mainstream narrative. Essentially, they've got you holding the back door open to help sneak all the actual fascists and actual Nazis in in the name of a joke, in the name of laughing at liberal tears. One day you're going to look around you and realize nobody's laughing anymore and you're surrounded by actual Nazis and well, you're an actual Nazi now. Now, this tactic is not new. Donald Trump has been doing this or a version of this his entire political career. This is the service that he provides for the giant financial elites that tell him what to do. Consumer capitalism has almost finished devouring itself and is no longer viable, so he's here to help speed up the march towards isolationist technocratic corporatocracy. That means more authoritarianism. It means weakening or dismantling the agencies that exist to keep monopolies in check. And usually it means creating a sense of unity through a collective sense of xenophobia, a fear or hatred for the other. About eight or nine years ago, Donald Trump got on stage and said, Mexicans are rapists. Some people got very upset and some people thought it was funny how upset those people got. They said, you're taking it too seriously. You're taking it out of context. And now the military are shipping people off to Guantanamo Bay with no due process to demonstrate that they're violent criminals or really criminals at all. So how far do you think this can go in the next eight or nine years?
