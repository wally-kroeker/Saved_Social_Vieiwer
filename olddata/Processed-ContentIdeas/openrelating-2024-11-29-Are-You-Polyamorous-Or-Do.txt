Are you polyamorous?

Or do you suffer from low self esteem and can't believe anyone will want to date you monogamously, since surely they will want to get some of their needs met elsewhere?

It's always good to inquire honestly what are your motivations for any type of relating, and sometimes it can be both an adaptation and orientation. The exploration is what gives you deeper insights into yourself.

If you aren't sure, coaching or therapy with a qualified and experienced practitioner can help.
