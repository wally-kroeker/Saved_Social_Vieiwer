# Full Transcription

~Sarah~: Let's learn to understand our emotions, part two. Your sadness is asking you to slow down and process your emotions instead of pushing them away. Your regret is a chance to grow, so use it as an opportunity to learn and make better choices instead of punishing yourself. Your grief is love or loss that is still lingering. You can allow yourself to honor this by feeling, remembering it, and allowing yourself the space to heal at a pace that feels good to you. Your irritation is a sign that something needs to change, so you'll want to identify the source instead of just trying to change it or avoid it. Self-doubt is just fear in disguise. You can challenge it by reminding yourself of past accomplishments. Comparison is a distraction from your own unique gifts, talents, needs, and preferences. You should focus on your own strengths and progress instead of someone else's. Your craving for validation is a want to be seen or connected to other people. You can balance this by also making sure to see and validate and connect with yourself. Your impatience is excitement without direction. Focus on making a plan and trying to put that plan into action. Your bitterness is coming from holding on too tightly to the past, and healing is going to get a lot easier and more manageable whenever you start to grieve and work through the things that have hurt you. Your overwhelm is a sign that you probably need support or rest. Let's remember that every feeling has a purpose, and if you can listen and learn, then you can move forward. Anyway, I hope that helps at least one person. My name is Sarah. I'm your favorite self-experimenting coach or companion, and I help get people reacquainted with who they most authentically are. You're an amazing person, and I hope you have the best day.
