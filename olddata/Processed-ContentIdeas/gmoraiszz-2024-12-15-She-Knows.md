# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: The reason why I started posting on TikTok is because if you post on TikTok every single day for an entire year, you'll never have to worry about money again.
~Speaker 2~: She's right because last month I made over $20,000 on just one of my TikTok pages. So let me actually show you what I do. The first thing I do when I head to my desk is pull out my phone and check the statistics for last month. And this page that I started recently has already made me $21,000. Now I have five pages that make me up to $40,000 every single month. And I was able to do this because AI does all the work for me. So this is exactly how I do it step by step. First thing I do when I open up my phone is head to crayo.ai. Once I'm here, I click the try now button and choose the text story section. Now I use the AI generator to make me a fake story, and then I click next to choose my theme. After choosing my theme, I then select my background gameplay, my background music, and my AI voices to read the text messages. Then I click generate and the whole video is done for me. Now I'll take this video and post it on TikTok because TikTok's currently paying $1,000 per million views. And last month I made $21,000 on just one of my TikTok pages. So if you want to do what I do, you can click the link in my bio.
