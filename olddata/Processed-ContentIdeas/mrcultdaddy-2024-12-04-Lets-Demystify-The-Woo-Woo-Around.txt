Let’s demystify the ‘woo-woo’ around meditation: It’s not just sitting still and chanting ‘Om.’ (Though Om/OHM are incredibly powerful techniques that i will explain later) Meditation is a tool to bypass your conscious, critical mind and tap into the subconscious where habits, beliefs, and creativity are formed. Whether it’s through breathwork, visualization, or even repetitive tasks like knitting, the goal is to quiet the chatter of your everyday mind. Why? Because that’s where the magic happens—accessing deeper awareness, reducing stress, and reprogramming your mindset for growth. 🧘‍♂️✨ #MeditationForEveryone #MindOverMatter #SubconsciousPower #MeditationTips #BrainHacks
