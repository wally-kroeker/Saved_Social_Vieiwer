# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Quick update on the series finale of the US.
~Speaker 1~: There have been a lot of executive orders signed and a lot of ice raids this first week of the presidency.
~Speaker 1~: The executive orders are setting the foundation for some larger part of the plan.
~Speaker 1~: If any of you have read Project 2025, I'm sure you can tell us what that is.
~Speaker 1~: I think that they were actually meant to force lawsuits.
~Speaker 1~: So the lawsuits that came out of the executive orders that were signed were hoped for.
~Speaker 1~: Elon Musk is going to be ousted from the White House inner circle.
~Speaker 1~: It seems that he was used probably to steal the election.
~Speaker 1~: And now that he has served his purpose, it seems like they will throw him out.
~Speaker 1~: Especially since he doesn't align ideologically and a lot of the diehard Trump supporters do not like Elon Musk.
~Speaker 1~: I think that at the end of the day, Elon was really seeking belonging and validation.
~Speaker 1~: And I see that boyish quality in many of the tech nerd billionaires that we have these days.
~Speaker 1~: I watched Mark Zuckerberg's interview with Joe Rogan and I really got from that conversation that Mark Zuckerberg needed approval from Joe Rogan and was kind of like a little boy that was there to impress him.
~Speaker 1~: But make no mistake that these men are behaving narcissistically.
~Speaker 1~: If they didn't start with narcissism, um they have been trained in it and are behaving as such.
~Speaker 1~: And the thing about a bunch of narcissists who get together to create a bromance is the bromance has no glue because everybody just has to compete and one up each other.
~Speaker 1~: And eventually all bros have to bow down to the greatest daddy in the room.
~Speaker 1~: The analogy with homoeroticism that comes with patriarchy is so funny to me.
~Speaker 1~: Someone asked if we should be worried about social security and Medicare being threatened.
~Speaker 1~: I do not think those are at risk.
~Speaker 1~: In fact, I think that we are likely to have universal health care by 2028.
~Speaker 1~: There are actually a lot of members of our government who want to protect us from the president.
~Speaker 1~: And so those forces will be working to protect those.
~Speaker 1~: We're much more likely to see successes when it comes to reproductive rights, restrictions, censorship, and human rights violations such as restrictions based on gender and race.
~Speaker 1~: Don't worry too much about the egg and milk shortages.
~Speaker 1~: The egg shortage has now hit Portland.
~Speaker 1~: We're having trouble finding eggs.
~Speaker 1~: The message that I'm getting with that is that chickens can be reproduced fairly quickly.
~Speaker 1~: Their life style is quick enough that we can recover.
~Speaker 1~: Milk is already overproduced.
~Speaker 1~: In fact, we waste a lot of milk because it is, I think maybe subsidized.
~Speaker 1~: We should be much more worried about the virus that is causing these shortages that is running its way through bird populations and cow populations.
~Speaker 1~: It will run itself through human populations.
~Speaker 1~: And at this point, it is merely a question of when.
~Speaker 1~: And unfortunately, the energy that could coalesce to solve that problem or help predict it, they're distracted by fighting the president.
~Speaker 1~: And so it'll be a similar case where we learned very little from the last one.
~Speaker 1~: And if there's anything that you realized you needed at the beginning of 2020 that you think about now, maybe it would be nice to have some extra masks around.
~Speaker 1~: Take care of those supplies now.
~Speaker 1~: Um, please don't go buy all the toilet paper.
~Speaker 1~: It is unclear to me the timeline.
~Speaker 1~: Could be this year, could be many years.
~Speaker 1~: There are some positives with this flu virus.
~Speaker 1~: I'm hearing that it is less deadly but more contagious.
~Speaker 1~: They already have a vaccine.
~Speaker 1~: I don't know if that vaccine is approved for humans, probably not.
~Speaker 1~: There are already rapid antigen tests and if the country is smart, they will already be producing those in excess in preparations.
~Speaker 1~: When I ask what would be the best home remedy for this flu, I'm getting breathing, so respirations, making sure that fresh air is coming into the body and that the sort of lungs are flushed with new energy and new circulation.
~Speaker 1~: And I'm also getting movement, so circulation, moving the blood, moving the lymph around.
~Speaker 1~: This flu causes a cytokine storm and the cytokines build up in the organs.
~Speaker 1~: And then it causes multiple organ failure.
~Speaker 1~: And it sort of advantages on the fact that sick people don't move around.
~Speaker 1~: Sick people are laying in bed and all their fluids are sort of pooling in their body.
~Speaker 1~: So it's a good idea to move around and to walk and to breathe and to like have circulation.
~Speaker 1~: Do lymphatic massage, hydrate well, flush the body so that the cytokines don't get um sort of built up in the organs.
~Speaker 1~: The waves of sickness and mass disabling events that we've seen help us sort of dissolve capitalism because capitalism does not respect being and rest.
~Speaker 1~: And so when most of the people in a society need rest and recovery, capitalism doesn't function.
~Speaker 1~: And it's a way to show that capitalism does not value our recovery.
~Speaker 1~: Those are all my updates.
~Speaker 1~: Let me know if you have questions.
