# Full Transcription

~John Vervaeke~: Human beings need to feel very connected to their environment. That's not optional. A second thing that's not optional is wisdom. We have to undertake practices that intervene in our general intelligence, that make us more capable of self-correction. You need a whole bunch of practices that can enhance that connectedness. You need people to model the practices to you because a lot of the learning isn't done through just learning propositions. You need a community, you need tradition. So this functionality was largely carried by religion. I'm not here advocating for religion, neither am I allergic to religion. The West has done something really unique in history. It has gone through a process of secularization. What's happening here is we're at this turning point about how we're trying to deal with the loss of the functionality of religion because being connected and being wise are not optional for us. We have to pursue them.
