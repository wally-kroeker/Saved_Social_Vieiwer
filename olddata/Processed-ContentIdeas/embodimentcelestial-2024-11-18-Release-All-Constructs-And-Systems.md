# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: no longer religious because my awareness has left the area of religion, just like being spiritual. I've evolved from the spiritualism. I learned what I needed to and now I just exist. When you look at religion, what is it? You blame demons. Spiritualism, you blame things that are still external, like bad spirits or bad omens, whatever it is. You look at astrology, I'm going to blame the alignment of the stars. Everyone's like, oh my god, I got my astrology reading. It's in such alignment with my life. How is that possible? What if you've already had this experience? My experience is based off of how I feel. I can create how I feel, and now I'm creating my experience. What is this experience? It's energy, frequency, and vibration. That means that the energy that you feel creates the frequency and the vibration of what you're living in. What is energy? Energy is your emotions. Emotions is energy in motion. Everything is an externalization. Once you see the algorithm, I'm no longer any of these things. My awareness is above it. I'm existing.
