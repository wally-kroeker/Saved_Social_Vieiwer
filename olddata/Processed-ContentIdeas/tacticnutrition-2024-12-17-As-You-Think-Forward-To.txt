As you think forward to 2025, think about your systems as much or more than you think about your goals. Think about what your specific limiters are and what routines, behaviors, and habits you can put into place to start to break them down.

If you are ready to stop striking out on your goals, stop looking at them to be some great motivator of daily action.

More motivation, more willpower, or just trying harder is never the answer. It’s never those things.

It’s how you set yourself up. It’s your systems. Plain and simple.

It’s pretty easy to set a goal, really. That’s not hard. And it can feel good and change the way we operate for a short period of time, but ultimately, we will fall back to our daily routines and systems, or lack thereof. The hard part of goal setting is not setting the goal, it’s putting the things in place that will support us getting there eventually.

Goals don’t do that, and they never will. 

It’s the daily doing. That is the way.
