That all being said...👇 

This isn't a call to action for supplements. We should always aim to get our nutrients through food first whenever possible since supplements do not work as effectively! (Plus, we should also only take supplements with a doctor's direction). 

I know that's not as easy with ADHD, but try to choose at least one-two from the list below a day:

Some good magnesium sources are:

🍫 Cocoa/cacao powder
🎃 Pumpkin seeds
🥛 Almonds/almond milk
🫘 Beans
🌾 Quinoa
🥣 Many cereals
🐄 Yogurt
🥦 Spinach/dark green veggies 
🥑 Avocado
🥔 Potato
