# Full Transcription

~Cristina Becher~: You realize it's 2025 and you can leverage AI to make extra income, right? So I'm gonna show you this right now and you're gonna be like, what the hell am I doing with my life? Here is this scanner that I found. I'm gonna show you exactly how to use it and exactly how I use it to make a little extra income. Obviously, I've used it to make a lot of extra income, but as a beginner coming into the space, you probably don't have as much capital, so you're welcome. So this is a scanner that basically scans whatever currency pair you want it to and it gives you entry and exit prices in the market. Literally all you're doing is copying those numbers and pasting it into your little device. I'm gonna show you right now because I've actually just entered this trade. Now, this is the platform that I use, it's called MetaTrader 5. So you're just gonna click on it and you're gonna find whatever currency pair it is. So we have XAUUSD and I'm gonna hit trade. Once I hit trade, I'm gonna see that there's two spots to input data, the stop loss and the take profit. So all I'm gonna do right here where it says TP, I'm gonna copy this number and I'm gonna paste it into the take profit. And where it says SL, this is our stop loss, so I'm gonna copy that number and I'm gonna paste it where it says stop loss. Because our profit area is below entry, we're going for a sell. So once I do that, all I have to do is hit sell by market. Really, it should look like this. So for the stop loss, we have 2895.1, stop loss 2895.1, take profit 2879.8, 2879.8 sell. And like I told you, I put a smaller amount of capital, so it'll be more realistic to the type of results that you'll probably see as a beginner. Let me show you. So in this account, I only deposited $100. I already took one trade obviously, but look, I've already made 16 and if it comes down and hits our take profit level, I will make $86 or Great British pounds. Like, are you actually joking me? I just refuse to believe that people know these things exist and choose not to use them because what? So if you're sitting there and you're like, dang, that's crazy. I could either do this at work or do this at home or while I'm sitting in the pickup line to pick up my kids. Do it because I know even just an extra $500 will go a long ways for a lot of people. If you understand the power of what I just showed you, DM me copy trading on Instagram.
