# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: I have someone in my comment section who's very adamant that these god-fearing men, the founding fathers, did not fear religion and very much wanted to set up a Christian nation, which is a very common myth.
~Speaker~: For this, I really recommend the book, Was America Founded as a Christian Nation, a historical introduction, which shows you how this myth was perpetuated.
~Speaker~: And he wants real quotes.
~Speaker~: You got it.
~Speaker~: Thomas Jefferson, history, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government.
~Speaker~: Also, Thomas Jefferson said that we have a right to entertain much doubt what parts of them are genuine when referring to the Bible, which he cut out all of the supernatural parts when he was sworn in through the Bible.
~Speaker~: We have James Madison, father of the Constitution, during almost 15 centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial.
~Speaker~: What has been its fruits?
~Speaker~: Pride, ignorance, superstition, bigotry, and persecution.
~Speaker~: We have the Treaty of Tripoli, which was started by George Washington and signed by John Adams and other founding fathers that says, quote, the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion, 1797.
~Speaker~: John Adams also said this would be the best all possible worlds if there were no religion in it.
~Speaker~: Thomas Payne, probably the most outspoken critic of organized religion of the founding fathers, said the Christian system of religion is an outrage on common sense, too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too inconsistent for practice.
~Speaker~: It renders the heart torpid or produces only atheists or fanatics.
~Speaker~: Benjamin Franklin, he was a deist.
~Speaker~: He did believe in a creator, but he was very skeptical of organized religion.
~Speaker~: On religious superstition, he said the way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason.
~Speaker~: Benjamin Franklin also said lighthouses are more useful than churches.
~Speaker~: George Washington also seemed to be a deist, even though he was more personal with his beliefs.
~Speaker~: He never directly references Jesus Christ in his speeches or his private letters.
~Speaker~: Instead, he uses vague terms like Providence or great ruler of the universe, which was common for deists who believed in a non-personal creator kind of God.
~Speaker~: He attended church, but he did not take communion.
~Speaker~: He did not believe in it.
~Speaker~: When his pastor criticized him for not taking communion, he stopped attending church altogether.
~Speaker~: Now, Washington did see the role of religion as encouraging morality and social stability, but he didn't believe that the government should enforce any kind of religious doctrine.
~Speaker~: Now, the statement that often gets cited by Christian nationalists is his farewell address in 1796, where he says of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.
~Speaker~: Now, he did not specify Christianity.
~Speaker~: He's speaking of religion in general as a way to promote virtue in society and provide moral education for people because there was no kind of secular education system that could do that.
~Speaker~: Religion was the only thing that could provide moral education and he saw value in that.
~Speaker~: Now, the naive argument that you hear a lot from Christian nationalists, including this guy, is that because they were, they occasionally issued calls to prayer or calls to fasting, that they actually did believe in God personally.
~Speaker~: But this is far more cultural than it is religious, and it's just too easy of an argument.
~Speaker~: That would be like saying, I believe in God because I have a Christmas tree.
~Speaker~: The founding fathers, even the ones who were very skeptical of religion, understood that calls to prayer could serve as a unifying tool for this young and very fragile nation.
~Speaker~: And they were very careful in public statements to use terms like Providence or nature's God or Almighty being to avoid explicitly supporting Christianity.
~Speaker~: So Washington and Adams as the first two presidents did do national calls to prayer, but Jefferson outright refused to do national calls to prayer.
~Speaker~: And many of the founding fathers regretted even doing that in later years.
~Speaker~: So James Madison, father of the Constitution in 1822, he was writing that he regretted doing some of these religious proclamations or national calls to prayer because they seem to imply and certainly nourish the erroneous idea of a national religion.
~Speaker~: So even though the founding fathers sometimes participated in religious events or went to church or calls to prayer, they did so reluctantly, and also they later questioned their appropriateness.
~Speaker~: But they did so because it was an expected role of leadership.
~Speaker~: So Tommy, if you've made it all the way to the end here, you've fallen prey to a very specific narrative.
~Speaker~: In the same way that any Christian can cherry-pick verses of the Bible and create basically any version of Christianity.
~Speaker~: By the mid-19th century with what we call the Great Second Awakening, there were Christian nationalists who were selectively quoting what the founding fathers were saying and highlighting that they were more religious than secular when the reverse is true.
~Speaker~: They were far more secular and students of the enlightenment than they were religious.
~Speaker~: In the 1950s, we had a bigger push to connect Christianity and American identity as a reaction against communism.
~Speaker~: And then of course, we have the rise of the religious right in the 1970s and 80s with figures like Jerry Fallwell and Pat Robertson.
~Speaker~: And I think the strongest quote that we have is that Treaty of Tripoli quote where we have unanimously by the Senate, signatures from all the founding fathers that explicitly states the government of the United States in America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.
~Speaker~: And if I were to push you a little bit here, if I were to just give you a little nudge into some critical thinking, we have to realize that these men were highly critical of religion, running experiments on religion.
~Speaker~: Uh, Benjamin Franklin was running all kinds of experiments.
~Speaker~: Thomas Jefferson's cutting up the Bible.
~Speaker~: They're highly skeptical of religion, and this was pre-Darwin.
~Speaker~: Pre-Darwin they're doing this.
~Speaker~: So if we use our critical thinking skills, what would these men with these kinds of ideals have done when they came across Darwin?
~Speaker~: Would they really be Christian nationalist trumpers today?
~Speaker~: Or would they probably be something like either UU, progressive Christians, secular Christians, atheists, uh, agnostics, secular humanists.
~Speaker~: They're far more likely to be in the secular humanist camp, but they didn't have the information then that we have now.
~Speaker~: So to conclude, I know, I know it's, it seems like solid evidence when they do these national calls to prayer that these are god-fearing men, but we have to realize that was pressure put on them as early leaders of this new country and that they all, they later regretted doing.
~Speaker~: And when we look at their private letters, which shows a lot more of their personal beliefs, we see a lot of doubt, we see a lot of skepticism, we see a lot of even fear of religion.
~Speaker~: And we see signs not of the Christian God, but of deism, which is some kind of creator God, some kind of like hand of the creator maybe guiding things, but very, very vague because they hadn't yet met Darwin.
~Speaker~: So it is just too simple to to just cherry-pick the, you know, the vague statements that they made in regards to God and miss what they actually were driven by and what were they were actually writing in their letters.
~Speaker~: And what they actually claimed America to be, which is not in any way founded on the Christian religion.
~Speaker~: I don't know of any legitimate historian today that looks at Thomas Jefferson, who was very skeptical of religion.
~Speaker~: So was James Madison, especially Thomas Payne was, and thinks that what they wanted is someone like Trump holding up a Bible.
~Speaker~: Like, like no one, no one legitimate in the field and not because of brainwashing from the political left.
~Speaker~: No one kind of can draw that line well.
~Speaker~: So I hope that helped.
~Speaker~: Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.
