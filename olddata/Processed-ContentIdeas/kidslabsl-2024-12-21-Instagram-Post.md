# Full Transcription

~Vanessa Van Edwards~: study he discovered. He wanted to know what makes popular kids popular. Very clever study. He studied thousands of high school students across a variety of high schools looking for patterns. Why is it that some kids across these grades and ages are really popular? He had all the kids ranked across all these schools. He had them looked at traits. And then he guessed what made the popular kids popular. Were they more athletic? Were they more attractive? Were they funnier? Were they smarter? What was it? Can you guess? Anyone?
~Unidentified Male~: Hmm, they were funny, happy, I don't know.
~Vanessa Van Edwards~: Okay, so he found that the most popular kids across the one single variable that was hold held true across all the different students was the most popular kids had the longest list of people they liked. And when he looked at their day-to-day, they had micro moments of liking. They would go down the hallway and be like, hey Chad, hey Chelsea. They liked so many people and that in turn made them more likable. This showed me that being likable is in our control. Being likable means you have to be first liker. If you set out to like more people, you become more likable.
