OpenAI’s President Greg Brockman just shared the best way to structure the perfect prompt.

The framework originally from Ben Hylak, is built on four key pillars:

1️⃣ Goal – Define what you want clearly.
2️⃣ Return Format – Specify exactly how you want the response structured.
3️⃣ Warnings – Highlight any important details the AI should double-check.
4️⃣ Context Dump – Provide background info to improve the response.
