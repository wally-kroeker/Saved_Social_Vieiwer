Just for fun, we let ChatGPT go while we were seeing these orbs in the sky. We don’t claim to know what these phenomena are, and since our government isn’t telling us, it’s up to “we the people” to make sense of it all. Treat this for entertainment purposes, because obviously AI is very brilliant, and on the night of January 25, 2025 in Saint Joseph, Michigan, we sure had a show. Note these are very different than the obvious drones comfirmed to be legit by the FAA. And also note, there are major airports across the lake, so we are very accustomed to seeing planes, but these orbs do not behave like planes at all, and hover for quite some time and even change shape. We’ve also seen one through a telescope and it basically looks like a ball of energy as seen under a microscope or something. Anyway, just enjoy and don’t take anything here too seriously. We’re all just learning along with each other. Have fun and stay brave but use discernment and always trust in your inner connection with God, as the Great Nazarene spoke about. 🙏🌟✨ #fun #mystery #orbs #uap #ufo #ufos #ufosighting #drones #diorbags #alien #aliens #uaps #uapnews #uapsighting #mystical
