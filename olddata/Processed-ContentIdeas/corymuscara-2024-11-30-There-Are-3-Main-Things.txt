There are 3 main things happening in any given moment:

1.	Our experience
2.	Our awareness of our experience
3.	The story we tell ourselves about our experience

Recognizing these 3 layers is crucial for living a more intentional and peaceful life.

Our experience is anything we perceive through our 5 senses or mind:

• I smell smoke.
• I see a red rose.
• I notice I’m angry.
• I feel tension in my shoulders.
• I’m thinking about my childhood.

Pretty straightforward.

Awareness is the part of us that knows what’s happening as it’s happening.

Your awareness of your fear is not fearful.
Your awareness of your pain is not in pain.
Your awareness of your thoughts is not thinking.

For example: Think the thought “I love jelly beans” ten times in a row. As you do, notice the part of you that knows you’re thinking that thought. 

That’s awareness.

Between experience and awareness, there’s a story we tell ourselves about what’s happening.

We see a dog (experience), we know we see a dog (awareness), and we think dogs are cute (story)

We’re sad (experience), we know we’re sad (awareness), and we believe sadness is weak (story).

Most of us don’t live in our experience—we live in our story about our experience.

Check out this haiku by Matsuo Basho:

The old pond.
A frog jumps in.
Plop.

No exaggeration, no added story. Just the experience.

The story we add is what creates stress. When we view our experience in its most basic form, it’s often less catastrophic than our mind makes it out to be.

When something activating happens, break it into these 3 layers:

1.	What’s my direct experience?
2.	Can I sense my awareness of this experience?
3.	What’s the story I’m telling about it?

Then ask: Can I soften my grip on the story and meet this moment in its simplest form?

Of course, some stories are useful: “I’m a great mother,” “My life will get better.” Stories can motivate and inspire, but hold them lightly. When we attach to a story, it locks us into how things should be, keeping us bound to ideas that may no longer be resonant.

When we let go of how things should go, we can respond in real time, adapting and moving fluidly through life like water.
