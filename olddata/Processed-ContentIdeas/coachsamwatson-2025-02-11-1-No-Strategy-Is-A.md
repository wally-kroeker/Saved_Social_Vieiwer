# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: I'm going to tell you how I get more shit done than I ever have in my life by doing less, and you're not going to like it. First, open your preferred note-taking tool, whatever makes it easiest for you to get everything out of your head. I used to use the notes app, now I use Coda. Second, I keep a running list of everything that needs to get done. If you're doing this for the first time, just info dump everything in your head. Third, I pick out all of the tasks that have to happen daily and make a separate list of those. Step four, find either the number one most stressful task on that list or the task that will have the biggest impact on your life to work on and put it at the top of that list. And the last and most important step you're going to hate, so I'm going to explain the reasoning first. Your problem is not how much you need to get done. Your problem is that you think you're supposed to get so much done that you end up freezing and feeling shit about yourself and then procrastinating. Your standards and your humanity are incompatible. You are not a robot and you cannot do as much as you think you're supposed to be able to. You will get so much further if you lower your expectations, cut out vanity tasks, and focus on the most valuable shit. So finally, the step you're going to hate, the second list is the only thing I ever work on or plan my time around, and I'm only allowed to move something from the main list to the daily list if the most stressful task is already dealt with. And if you do this, you will get more shit done than you ever have in your life by doing less because you will be in less stress, less self-criticism, more inspiration, and you'll give yourself a proper chance to be a fucking human being. Comment hate if you'd like some more help figuring out how to get on top of shit in your life.
