# Full Transcription

~Adyashanti~: Belief is what we do when we don't know, but we're not comfortable enough to stay there. Then we start believing. Belief is an utter and absolute lack of faith. Often we got belief and faith as if they're the same thing. I believe because I have faith. No, you believe because you have no faith. If you have faith, you can sustain, you can, you can stay in the place of not knowing. That takes great trust, great faith, great capacity to stay completely and absolutely honest. And spiritually speaking, that's one of the keys that unlock the whole kingdom is the ability to sustain not knowing, to sustain being completely and ruthlessly honest.
