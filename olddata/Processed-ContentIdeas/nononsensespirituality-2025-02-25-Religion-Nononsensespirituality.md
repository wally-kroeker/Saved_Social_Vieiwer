~Speaker 1~: Love for your enemies, love for the poor, and especially love for outside of your tribe.
~Speaker 1~: For Mormonism, I would say it's what's called the sociological genius of Mormonism, which is just drawing a square on a map and saying, love these people.
~Speaker 1~: For Hinduism, I would say multiple paths for spiritual practice.
~Speaker 1~: There's not really something like atheism in Hinduism because there's so many available paths of practice that it doesn't really produce atheists.

~Speaker 1~: The best of no nonsense spirituality would be your freedom in being able to craft a life worth living for you.
