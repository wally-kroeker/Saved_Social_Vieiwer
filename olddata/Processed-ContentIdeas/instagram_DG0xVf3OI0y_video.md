# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Did AI just break filmmaking? Because what you're watching right now is absolutely insane. Someone took the Game of Thrones trailer and turned it into a Lego version. Not a stop motion remake or CGI, this was fully AI generated using an app called InVideo AI. But here's the crazy part. It didn't take weeks, it only took a few minutes. InVideo AI analyzes every frame of the video to understand things like shapes and texture and lighting, and then it uses that information to rebuild the entire video in a completely different style. This means it can reconstruct any video in Lego, Pixar, anime, and basically any style that you want. Just imagine the possibilities with this. Want to watch Star Wars in Studio Ghibli style? Done. You want to watch Breaking Bad as an early 2000s cartoon? Easy. The crazy part is you don't need any editing skills. Just upload your video, describe the style that you want, and InVideo AI does the rest. So if you could reimagine any movie or TV show in a completely different style, what would you pick?
