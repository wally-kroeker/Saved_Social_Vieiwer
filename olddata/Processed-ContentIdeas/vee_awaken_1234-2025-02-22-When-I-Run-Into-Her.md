~Speaker 1~: The ultimate test?

~Speaker 1~: No matter what.

~Speaker 1~: No matter the trigger, no matter the lie, no matter the manipulation,

~Speaker 1~: no matter the inconsideration or the disregard, you show up as your most integral self. And the most integral self is universal. The most integral self is accepting and forgiving and patient. This does not mean to disregard your own boundaries around these situations.

~Speaker 1~: It simply means that you have mastered the way that your nervous system perceives and responds to threat. When your nervous system responds to someone lying or manipulating or using, it's because you are giving that situation and that reality power to be real and true. And any amount of energy or mind space and real estate that you give to any other reality outside of acceptance, it's taking away from the reality of your truest desires.

~Speaker 1~: Because your truest desires do not be lied to. It's to be surrounded by truth tellers and integral people such as yourself. The sign that you have entered into and consented to the test is that you are now aware. You are conscious of the opportunities that are presented within every triggering situation. It's that every time your nervous system is activated, your first response is not what they did to you, but of the test. And the masters of the test begin climbing the ranks of the game very quickly. Because your manifesting machine is no longer being fed information in the form of thoughts, of rumination and preoccupation and lower negative frequency that aligns with a lower negative reality that distracts you from that which you truly desire.

~Speaker 1~: The test is to distract you and to test you as to whether or not you are ready through that which you claim to truly desire.
