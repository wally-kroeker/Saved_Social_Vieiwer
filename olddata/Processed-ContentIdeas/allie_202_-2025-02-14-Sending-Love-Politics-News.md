# Full Transcription

~stillwerise~: Same-sex marriage isn't gay privilege, it's equal rights. Privilege would be something like gay people not paying taxes, like churches don't. No immigrant has taken your job. You were laid off by a capitalist who required cheap labor and took advantage of that immigrant to increase his profits, and nothing makes him happier than to hear you blame the immigrant and not him. Scientists in the 90s, we cloned a sheep. We landed a robot on Mars. Scientists today, for the last time, the Earth is round. I need someone to explain to me why it's always if you can't pay rent, buy fewer lattes and avocado toast, and not if you can't pay your employees a living wage, buy fewer yachts, rockets, and spacecraft. Explain it to me like I'm in kindergarten. Reminder that you're an adult and you can literally drunk dial your senators whenever you want. There's been a 3,000% increase in calls to Congress because you are not powerless and he is not unstoppable. Look at and learn from the funding freeze and how quickly he was forced to surrender. Birthright citizenship order blocked, federal funding cut off blocked, illegal feds resignation plan blocked, access to Treasury's vital data system blocked, firing 2,000 US aid workers blocked, drastic NIH grant cuts blocked, removing public health websites blocked. We have the power to get in the way. Courts are doing it, Congress people are doing it, and you can do it by calling the US Capital switchboard and asking to speak to your representative and your senator and give them a piece of your mind. Remember not just to follow people that give you fear, but people who give you hope and action items. Because unfortunately, my politics are rooted in a deep love for humanity and the exhausting belief that a better world is possible. And if you watch this channel, I assume so are yours. Give yourself a hug, okay? I'll see you soon.
