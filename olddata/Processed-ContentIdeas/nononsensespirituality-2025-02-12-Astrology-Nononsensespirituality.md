# Full Transcription

~[Speaker Name]~: Astrology isn't true.


~[Speaker Name]~: Astrology isn't true in the same way that religions aren't true.


~[Speaker Name]~: But that's not the end of the conversation because what is it doing that is helpful is probably a better question.


~[Speaker Name]~: Because very untrue religions are still followed by people who find it extraordinarily helpful.


~[Speaker Name]~: We have done so many studies and meta studies and meta studies on the meta studies on astrology to see if there's anything there and there is nothing.


~[Speaker Name]~: There is no science relating the positions and movements of planets to human personality.


~[Speaker Name]~: So why does it work?


~[Speaker Name]~: It works because it's a mirror for self-exploration.


~[Speaker Name]~: That's what it's doing.


~[Speaker Name]~: Even Carl Jung, who was an expert on archetypes, sometimes found with a client when he couldn't figure out what was going on with this client, he would just open up their star chart, start looking at things and he it would help him.


~[Speaker Name]~: It was a creative process that helped him to see some complexity in his client that he wasn't seeing before.


~[Speaker Name]~: But you could do the same thing with Greek mythology.


~[Speaker Name]~: So now the question becomes if this is just a mirror to help you understand what you are, then is this a good mirror?


~[Speaker Name]~: Because I can't deny that some people learn about themselves and their own psyche through astrology.


~[Speaker Name]~: I think that you can prove.


~[Speaker Name]~: But is it the best mirror?


~[Speaker Name]~: I have to say no.


~[Speaker Name]~: And that's because astrology in order for it to work, you have to believe it.


~[Speaker Name]~: You have to believe certain truth claims as true.


~[Speaker Name]~: So you're operating on faith just like you would in a religion, but then also it is so heavily dependent on biases that it's almost impossible to use it as a tool without getting sucked into the biases.


~[Speaker Name]~: This includes hindsight bias most especially because you look back and say, oh yeah, that all makes sense, you know, because of the chart.


~[Speaker Name]~: This includes the Barnum effect, it includes confirmation bias.


~[Speaker Name]~: And a lot of spiritual bypassing where you're not taking responsibility for your own actions and choices because of what's going on with the planets.


~[Speaker Name]~: It's like saying it's not my fault I'm late because Mercury's in retrograde.


~[Speaker Name]~: And just like with religion, it can make you incredibly judgmental.


~[Speaker Name]~: Have you ever met someone who's really into astrology who won't even be on a date with a person because they're an Aries?


~[Speaker Name]~: So is it a tool?


~[Speaker Name]~: Yes.


~[Speaker Name]~: It is a tool to help you discover the complexity of what you are as a human.


~[Speaker Name]~: Is it true?


~[Speaker Name]~: Categorically no.


~[Speaker Name]~: Categorically no.


~[Speaker Name]~: And is it the best mirror?


~[Speaker Name]~: I would say also no.


~[Speaker Name]~: I would do anygram over astrology, I would do spiral dynamics, I would do family systems.


~[Speaker Name]~: I would do Myers Briggs, I would do big five personality.


~[Speaker Name]~: I would do shadow work and ego work.


~[Speaker Name]~: I would do mindfulness and meditation, I'd do thought work.


~[Speaker Name]~: I'd do mythology and archetype work.


~[Speaker Name]~: I'd do working with stories.


~[Speaker Name]~: All of those are going to be better mirrors for deep inner work with less problems of becoming dependent on spiritual bypassing and cognitive biases.


~[Speaker Name]~: And I would say that for both Eastern and Western approaches to astrology.


~[Speaker Name]~: They are different.


~[Speaker Name]~: I understand that they are different, but they're basically doing the same thing.
