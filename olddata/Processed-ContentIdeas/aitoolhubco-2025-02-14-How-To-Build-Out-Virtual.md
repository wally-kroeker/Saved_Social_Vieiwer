# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: If you want to start building your virtual team that's built through AI and is all AI, let me give you a really simple hack to do that and it's building out my entire C suite.
~Speaker~: I want you to go into chat GPT, and I want you to tell it that you need a job description for say a COO and it's going to be the best job description that will attract the highest and best talent.
~Speaker~: Then, from that job description, you are then going to tell it to create a prompt utilizing that job description to create a chat GPT bot.
~Speaker~: Go create your bot and now you have a actual bot based on the job description that will perform the duties that you want it to.
~Speaker~: Build out a COO and a CFO, build out a whole bunch of other ones for content writers, social media marketers, and I'm literally building this off of what the best in the world would want, treating it like it's a person and it's going to maximize efficiency.
