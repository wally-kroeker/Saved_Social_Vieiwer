# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Very best content is disappearing from search engines, and it's changing everything about marketing. I've been tracking a massive shift, and the best creators and experts are not putting their content on a website for Google anymore. Instead, they're moving to places like Substack or private communities on Discord or paid newsletters. And here's why all of this matters. We're now experiencing a two-tiered internet. You have the public web, which is AI generated, recycled content, and then you have the private web, which is original insights and expert takes. And unless it's marked public, meaning it's not behind a paywall, Google can't index any of this content. But here's where it gets interesting. Over the next 12 months, we're going to see search traffic become less valuable. We'll also start to see more brands launching paid communities. And this is going to create a big shift when it comes to we as consumers finding trusted information online. So if you're a marketer or a founder, here's what I want you to focus on. Start building your own community or newsletter. Focus on original insights that cannot be AI generated, and start using getting familiar with some of these platforms. The brands that will win in 2025 are focused on building spaces that they own.
