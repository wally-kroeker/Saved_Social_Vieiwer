for most of my life, i thought my inner voice knew me best. so when it told me that i could never be good enough, never did enough, could never compare to everyone else, i believed it. and i felt like every bad thought i had meant that i was a bad person.

my whole life changed when i realized that a whole lot of the time, that voice isn't actually me. it's messages that i've internalized from a culture that doesn't want me to feel at ease with myself and whose values are often completely at odds with what i actually believe.

over the past few years, i've gotten really good at catching my brain when it's being a bully and saying, "NOPE WE'RE NOT DOING THIS!"

and it has truly literally changed my life.

a tip that i used when i first started on this journey: when your brain says something mean, imagine it being said again in the voice of someone you despise. i found that makes it a lot easier to tell it to shove off ðŸ¥°
