# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: What pissed me off the most, I said I was going to say calm, I'm not going to say fucking calm. What pissed me off the most about the state of the Union address, besides the fact that it was a full out lie and we are in full-fledged idolatry right now, was when he said I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. Coming from the man who's never had God in his life at any point, has openly said it in an interview, he's never asked God for forgiveness. He's never lived righteously, and the only thing he's shown himself to worship is himself. But it reminded me so much of another quote that I remember hearing was, I believe that I am acting as an agent of our creator, that the work that Christ started but could not finish, I, Adolf Hitler, will conclude.

~Speaker~: And that's before I get to the fact that the house budget that was passed didn't say anything about not taxing tips or not taxing overtime, and Project 2025 talks about getting rid of overtime. That's before we talk about the fact that transgender mice don't exist. That's transgenic, you fucking moron. It's genetically modified mice. We use to study and test medicines to cure people because we can't test on people.

~Speaker~: And using a cancer patient after you've cut all cancer research. The fact that we have not given $350 billion to Ukraine, it's $114 billion in response to a treaty we signed that we agreed to for them to get rid of their nukes.

~Speaker~: Thousands of 100 plus year old people are getting social security. No, they're fucking not. The 18.9 million people listed as over 100 in social security, most of them just don't have their date of death updated, and almost none of them, almost none of that group are getting social security at all. The acting social security administrator put in place by Trump has discredited this.

~Speaker~: No sex changers for kids are happening. They never were. They never were. Gender affirming surgeries that happened for minors in 2022 was 150. 147 of those were straight young men who were removing excess breast tissue, which you can imagine would be horrible for a straight young man to have in middle school and high school. There were no bottom surgeries done. Because there there's been no surgeries happening for minors. But what you have done by passing these laws and this hateful rhetoric towards this group is you've increased the risk of suicide by up to 72%. The rates through the roof. Pro-life.

~Speaker~: Critical race theory is a law class that's never been taught in K through 12. And by the way, you want to talk about making America great again while you're selling American citizenship so we can get more ketamine Kens in here? That's great.

~Speaker~: Speaking of Dodge, claiming they're saving money while giving billions of dollars in contracts to Musk, and the things they are claiming they're canceling are either paid out in full or cost so much to deny those payments, it would save us no money. And they're not investigating the agencies who have failed their audits pretty consistently like the Department of Defense.

~Speaker~: Oh, and now you're suddenly mad about heckling? Really? Really? Okay.
