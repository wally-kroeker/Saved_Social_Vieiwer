# Full Transcription

~Presenter~: just built an AI agent that's sole purpose is to get calls booked on my calendar by sending highly personalized emails that look like this. And I want to show you exactly how I did it because it's all built with no code. So make sure to save this video if you're the type of person who likes building stuff like this, or you've been thinking about starting a side hustle. So our agent triggers the lead scraping process based on details of people that we specify, like job title, industry, location. And then from there, it's going to start pulling people's LinkedIn profiles off of Google. Once we clean up that data, we're going to cross check it against a second source to make sure it's accurate. And then comes the magic part, when we enrich the lead. It's this step that makes the AI so effective at sending these personalized emails. Also, by the way, for a way deeper dive on my entire playbook for how I make money as a consultant, building no code workflows like this, I'm teaching a live class this week. So now we're going to take our leads contact info and pass it into a tool called Clearbit, which gives us a bunch more data about them. And then we're going to do another Google search that scrapes their socials and their website and articles, everything we can find about them. All of that information is then going to get saved into a spreadsheet. And then from there, our agent has everything that it needs in order to fire off a top tier outbound email.
