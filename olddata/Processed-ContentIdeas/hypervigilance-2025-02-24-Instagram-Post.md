# Full Transcription

~Speaker~: Right. So the CPTSD of being raised by narcissistic parents usually like starts to really rear its ugly head in our 30s. And and this is exactly right. I help people with this for a living. And so, um, you realize you're just playing a role. And so how do we heal from this? It it it I mean, it's a door that we should really question whether we even want to open because once it's opened, that's our life now. Because we heal by tearing down what was. We have to get rid of the life we had to have the life we deserve. That's like a quote from somebody or some shit, but like it's true. And so, you know, it begins by understanding that like we're not ourselves. That our authentic self has been like relegated into our shadow. That in attempts to connect to our parents and to remain safe as children, we contorted ourselves and we developed our own systems of masking and we developed our own actual narcissism. It may not be pathological, but we have a lot of behavioral patterns rooted in in learning from our parents. Everybody learns their from their parents, not just by what they say, but by watching them and by osmosis. And so the healing is about deconstructing our false sense of self, figuring out what we like. And here's the thing. It's like we almost have to like there's like this moment where we're like suspended in water and we have to disconnect from everything that we think makes us us and go over them and say is this us? Like like me, it's like, okay, my dad owned record labels. So do I like music or was it just like trying to connect to my dad? No, I like music. I love it. Uh, we went to movies every Saturday. So do I love movies or do is this just connecting to my dad? No, I fucking love movies. But then you get other things and you're going, oh, like like basketball, which is crazy because like I was an amazing basketball player. Um, and then I quit after my sophomore year and I was on pace to play Division One college basketball and everybody got really mad at me. But that's because my mother loved sports. I do love sports, but like I you know, the basketball thing was crazy because like my house burned down, like my dad had just built a massive house close to my mother's, didn't ask me to live there, so I was living in a hotel by myself as like a 16-year-old and got busted smoking weed. I told my coach, my coach called me like a pothead, so I'm like, fuck this guy, I don't want to play for him anymore. I'm just going to play on my All-State AAU team and then my AAU coach got hired as a college coach somewhere, which meant I couldn't even talk to him. And by that point I was just like, fuck it, I'm going to I'm going to like I just like watched Dazed and Confused. I'm like, fuck it, I'm going to become a pothead. I'm a pothead now. Um, but sorry, I digress. The the the healing has to be approached enthusiastically actually because it's depressing as shit. It it's really hard to build a sense of self out of the ashes of what the narcissistic parent has left us with, right? Where where we first have to kick them out of our mind. Kick them out. We have what's called the narcissistic introject where the parent like places themselves as an unreliable narrator in the seat of our consciousness. So that's step number one and then step number two is building a sense of self through boundaries.
