~Courtlynn Johnson~: Not trying to be rude, but if you don't have a LinkedIn featured section on your LinkedIn profile, you are a dumb dumb. You are missing out on thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars throughout your career of opportunities if you don't have a LinkedIn featured section. I know that sounds dramatic. Trust me, let me explain. For reference, this is a LinkedIn featured section. You just go to your profile, add new section, add featured section. You've seen this on other people's profiles. The goal of the featured section is to make you look like a thought leader. It doesn't matter if you are one or not. We're going to make you look like one so other people perceive you as more competent than you actually are. But Courtney, what do I put in my LinkedIn featured section? Well, I'm going to tell you. First thing, put a paid Calendly scheduling link. Put something like one hour, one-on-one consulting session in your area of expertise for 200 bucks. It does not matter if anybody actually books it or not. The fact that you have a paid consulting link looks very good from a brand perspective. Number two, put any podcast guest appearances that you've had in your LinkedIn featured section. If you want to get on podcasts, either Google podcast guest application in your niche or use Podmatch. I've personally never used Podmatch before, but every single time I post a video about getting on podcasts, you guys are all in my comments being like, Podmatch, use Podmatch. So like, I've never used it, but maybe it'll work for you.
