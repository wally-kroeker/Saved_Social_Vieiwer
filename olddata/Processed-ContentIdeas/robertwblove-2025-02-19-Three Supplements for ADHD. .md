# Full Transcription

~Robert Love~: Three supplements for ADHD. If you're new to my channel, hi, my name is Robert Love. I'm a neuroscientist and I specialize in helping people prevent Alzheimer's disease with science. So I myself have ADHD, so I'm very familiar with this question. Supplement number one, uh, a lot of people don't know about this one. It is Huperzine A. Huperzine A, spelled H U P E R Z I N E A. This increases an important neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is involved in the hippocampus, the memory center of your brain. And so by increasing acetylcholine, this can improve learning and memory. Supplement number two, this one's really powerful for ADHD and brain fog, it is L-tyrosine, L-tyrosine. This is an amino acid found in protein, and this is basically a precursor to dopamine. You've heard of dopamine. Dopamine is a very important neurotransmitter. A lot of ADHD drugs increase dopamine. And so L-tyrosine is a very gentle way of increasing dopamine and dopamine activity in the brain without taking a prescription drug.

~Robert Love~: Supplement number three, this helps reduce the stress of ADHD, improves memory, and can even improve sleep. It is Lion's Mane. Lion's Mane is a medicinal mushroom used in ancient Chinese and Japanese medicine, and we're just now learning in Western medicine how powerful it is. Lion's Mane improves memory in both animal studies and in human studies. Lion's Mane reduces stress and anxiety, and Lion's Mane even improves sleep. I love you, God bless you.
