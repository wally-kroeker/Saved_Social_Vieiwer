# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Here's a modern day spiritual practice that you have never heard of. It's called back testing the universe. For anybody that's ever done stock trading, you can go and back test your way into success. It's kind of cool and you can see the trends of what takes place in order to get the stock to do what it does. Now, the thing is is that most of us don't actually stay in discipline of being able to pay attention to those signals. But for any of us that have had amazing lives or even hard lives, we can go back and we can see the origin of everything that has been created that land us into the situation that we are right now. There's no accidents in the universe. And they're all wildly synchronistically built. It's like you meet this person and then it leads to this other thing and all of a sudden if you hadn't done this then it wouldn't have opened this door. And I've gone through the process of back testing my way all the way back to when I was five years old. And I can see the trends that have taken place that have gotten me right to where I'm at today. And the coolest thing is is that I love myself more than ever. So I know that all the stuff that I ever went through, all the sexual abuse that happened to me as a child, all the depression, all the suicide attempts and even me being incarcerated led me to this spot right now that has given me the most abundant, beautiful life that I could have ever had. When you go through the process of back testing everything that happens in the universe, you can see when things are coming before they happen. And all we have to do is rise above them so we can understand where the creator, not the victim of all the things that happen in your life. So I encourage each of us to back test our lives so we can understand how the universe has been constructing itself and laying out the red carpet for our lives. All we have to do is receive it and when we do, life will forever change. Thank you and I love you.
