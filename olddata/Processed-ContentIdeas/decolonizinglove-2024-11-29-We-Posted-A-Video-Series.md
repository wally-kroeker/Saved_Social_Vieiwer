# Full Transcription

~Man~: Millie, ready for another foreign adventure?
~Millie~: Why?
~Man~: Well, there's this job in finance that I'm thinking of applying to in Seattle. It's a contract position for one year.
~Millie~:
~Man~: So you want to come with me?
~Millie~: Oh, hon. Sorry, not this time. I moved with you to Montreal and then, you know, seven years ago I moved to Calgary and Vancouver two years ago. I just, I'm just tired of traveling so much. I just want to have a little stability. I think I'm going to stay in Toronto for now. But, hey, if they like fly your partners over, you know, expat conjugal visits, I can come like once a month.
~Man~: But this is going to be the first time in 13 years that we're not going to be together and you're not going to be coming with me.
~Millie~: Yeah, but it's okay, you know. You always wanted to be in the Northwest and like you can always have other girlfriends, you know? That's the egalitarian way. Rebecca doesn't have a job right now. She can get a job, you know, in the tech industry there.
~Man~: True. Um, Rebecca might be likely to say yes, but Jessie, I'm not sure because she has kids and she might not be able to move.
~Millie~: Well, that's up for you to figure out with your other girlfriends, but just know me and you, we're good forever. I'll always love you and after 13 years, like nothing's going to change that, okay? We'll always be together.
