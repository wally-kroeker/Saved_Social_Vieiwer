# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: Dude, look at this landing page. Look at this logo wall. Look at this footer though.
~Speaker 2~: Bro, can you imagine if we were still designing interfaces with raster tools like Photoshop?
~Speaker 1~: Guys, it's 2025 and you can create dynamic nav bars like this in Framer, or physics driven motion like this background with Unicorn Studio. Look at this temperature slider. This was made in Rive. None of this required coding. All of this is production ready and it performs great. Never mind Figma, never mind AI tools, both great. We're quietly seeing the revolution of design tools right now that are helping non-technical designers juice up their interfaces in ways that usually take award-winning agencies months to do. You can do this kind of work right now in hours by yourself. Start playing with Rive or Framer, Unicorn Studio, Jitter or Spline. This is the year to become an absolute sicko with new design tools. You're welcome.
