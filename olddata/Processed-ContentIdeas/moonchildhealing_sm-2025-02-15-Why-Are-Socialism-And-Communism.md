# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: My video about the fall of Empire went viral, but it seems like some sheeple, I mean patriots, are mad, and y'all need a history lesson. So here we go. During the Cold War, the United States government told us that communism was the greatest threat to freedom and democracy. They sold us the domino theory, the idea that if one country fell to communism, neighboring countries would follow like dominos. They made us believe that this would lead to a world without freedom, without prosperity. But let's look at what was really happening. The United States wasn't just protecting democracy. They were protecting capitalism, a system that depends on exploitation, on commodification of basic human needs, on ensuring a constant flow of cheap labor and resources. Communism and socialism threatens this system. Why? Because they challenge the idea that profit should come before people. They promoted ideas of equality, of workers owning the means of production, of resources being shared for the common good. And that was a direct threat to the capitalist agenda.

~Speaker 1~: So what did the Empire do? They overthrew democratically elected leaders who even resembled socialist or communist ideologies. Iran, Guatemala, Chile, Congo, Indonesia, the list goes on. They destabilized nations, backed coups, assassinated leaders, and installed puppet governments that would play by their rules, allowing the continued exploitation of land, labor, and resources. This wasn't about protecting freedom. It was about protecting profit, about making sure no other system could challenge the power and the wealth that the capitalistic empire provides to the few. They brainwashed us into fearing communism and socialism without ever truly understanding what they stood for. And now we are witnessing the consequences. People are fleeing countries that were destabilized by the United States Corporation, seeking refuge from violence, poverty, and corruption, situations that the United States created. And yet, leaders like Trump demonize immigrants, calling for walls, deportation, and closed borders. Why? Because immigrants are the reminder, a reminder of the horrors of colonization, of patriarchy, of white domination that ravaged the planet for centuries, a reminder of the cost of capitalism.
