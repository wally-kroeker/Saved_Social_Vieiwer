~Unidentified Speaker~: Just five minutes of Tibetan exercise beats an hour of running and your whole medicine cabinet. Monks call these exercises the key to healthy longevity. First time improves blood flow, reduces swelling, and normalizes blood sugar levels. On day two, joint recovery begins. Third time, blood pressure returns to normal. Day four, the body starts cleansing itself of parasites and toxins. Day five, metabolism speeds up and fat burning begins. These are simple exercises. They'll quickly relieve pain and major health issues.
