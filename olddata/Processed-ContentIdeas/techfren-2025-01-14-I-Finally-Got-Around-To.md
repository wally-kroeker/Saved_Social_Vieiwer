**3. Discussion and Content Covered:**

The meeting was a presentation and demonstration focused on AI agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Here's a breakdown of the key topics and elements shown:

*   **Introduction to AI Agents:** The presenter explained the concept of AI agents as entities that can dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, contrasting them with traditional, predefined code workflows.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** The core of the presentation revolved around MCP, a protocol (likely developed by Anthropic, as mentioned in the audio) that standardizes how AI agents gather context and interact with tools. This simplifies the integration of various functionalities into AI agents.
*   **GitHub Repository (`modelcontextprotocol/servers`):** The presenter showed the GitHub repository for MCP servers, highlighting its popularity (6.8k stars, 801 forks) and the MIT License. This indicates an open-source project.
*   **Development Setup:** The presenter walked through the development setup for the project, emphasizing the requirements (Node.js 16.x+, npm 7.x+) and the steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and configure the environment. This was a practical, hands-on demonstration.
*   **Web Application Interface (Localhost):** The presenter demonstrated a web application (running locally at `http://localhost:5173/agent/edit/systemprompt%20default`) for managing and editing AI agents. This interface included sections for basic agent information (name, description) and likely configuration settings.
*   **`systemprompt.io` Project:** The presenter showcased a voice-enabled AI agent built using the `systemprompt.io` project. This agent leverages MCP to access tools, specifically mentioning DuckDuckGo search as an example. This was a live demonstration of the practical application of the concepts discussed.
*   **Mentioned Websites/Platforms:** The presenter referenced several websites and platforms relevant to the AI agent ecosystem, including Anthropic, Smithery, Glamour.ai, and systemprompt.io. This provided context and showed the broader landscape of tools and resources available.
* **Excalidraw:** The presenter used Excalidraw to draw the words "AI Agent" and "Loving".

**4. Additional Information (Nature of the Event):**

This event is best described as a technical presentation and live coding demonstration, likely targeting developers and individuals interested in building or working with AI agents. It's not a formal meeting in the traditional sense (e.g., a business meeting with a set agenda). Instead, it's more akin to a webinar, workshop, or tutorial, where the presenter shares their knowledge and demonstrates a project they've developed. The interactive chat element suggests a degree of audience engagement and Q&A. The presenter is clearly guiding the audience through the technical details of setting up and using the AI agent system, making it a practical and informative session.

# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: A buzzword that people are loving, they're saying 2025 is the year of AI agents.
~Speaker 1~: Everyone is saying the best definition of agents is found on this blog post by Anthropic.
~Speaker 1~: Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths, whereas agents can dynamically direct their own process and tool usage.
~Speaker 1~: So that's a big part of it.
~Speaker 1~: If it's creating its own tools, it's definitely an agent, I'll say.
~Speaker 1~: Anthropic did something awesome around this whole function calling and tool use.
~Speaker 1~: Model context protocol.
~Speaker 1~: I cannot draw or, but essentially, how I understand it is like they've standardized a protocol for these agents to be able to gather context, to be able to use tools, to be able to call functions.
~Speaker 1~: And there's all these nice places.
~Speaker 1~: Shout out to Smithery.
~Speaker 1~: Shout out to glamour.ai.
~Speaker 1~: And there's also github.com/modelcontextproviders/servers.
~Speaker 1~: Hundreds of servers to do whatever you want.
~Speaker 1~: If you want to access Google Drive, if you want to access, you know, your Postgres, puppetry, literally any function, any tool that you think your agent could need, you could probably find it on one of these websites.
~Speaker 1~: And then, so that's the server side, that's the functions.
~Speaker 1~: Then there's also all these clients.
~Speaker 1~: You can find at pulsemcp.com/clients.
~Speaker 1~: Client is a really popular coding assistant, and they've got really nice MCP integration.
~Speaker 1~: The ones, I wanted something that I could chat to with my voice, and then it be able to have all these different tools, and I didn't want to have to write the tools myself, and that's where MCP makes it so easy.
~Speaker 1~: You just put in the configuration for an MCP server, and then you have access to all these tools.
~Speaker 1~: So what I found is this, systemprompt.io, uh, or multimodal MCP client.
~Speaker 1~: Easy setup.
~Speaker 1~: It's just a node, uh, project here.
~Speaker 1~: You get clone, NPM install, add your Gemini API key, and that's it to run the base.
~Speaker 1~: And then adding your own MCP, go into the MCP config.json, and I've added this DuckDuckGo CP server.
~Speaker 1~: Look, it's literally like three strings, MPX command-y DuckDuck MCP.
~Speaker 1~: That's all you need.
~Speaker 1~: Here, the DuckDuckGo server, and then once you connect that, it'll give you the tools.
~Speaker 1~: And so there's a search tool that takes, you know, query and options.
~Speaker 1~: And then we just have DuckDuckGo search available for our agent.
~Speaker 1~: I'm going to talk to this agent.
~Speaker 1~: Hey, can you do a search on DuckDuckGo for the price of Bitcoin?
~Speaker 2~: Sure, I can do that for you.
~Speaker 2~: Would you like me to search for the current price of Bitcoin?
~Speaker 2~: Okay, the price of Bitcoin is currently fluctuating around $94,000 USD.
~Speaker 2~: Several sources provide slightly different numbers, but they all indicate a price in that range.
