  "title": "Shanika Malcolm on Instagram: \"The dominance of masculine energy has disconnected us from the feminine, from our emotions, from the Earth, and from each other. Boys are taught that emotions are weakness, while women are conditioned to fit into systems that don’t honor them. This imbalance has shaped a world that prioritizes power over love, logic over intuition, and profit over life.\n\nBut this isn’t just about men or women—it affects us all. Healing begins when we restore balance, honor both energies, and return to the wisdom of the heart.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Drop them in the comments.\n\n#FeminineEnergy #MasculineEnergy #Patriarchy #Balance #DivineFeminine #DivineMasculine #Healing #SacredFeminine #SacredMasculine #SpiritualAwakening #EarthWisdom #heartcenteredleadership #shakti #shiva #sacredunion #tantra\"",
