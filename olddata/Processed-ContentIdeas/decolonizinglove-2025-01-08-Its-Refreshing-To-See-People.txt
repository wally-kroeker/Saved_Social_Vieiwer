It’s refreshing to see people drawing connections between the colonial-patriarchy and its current manifestation in fascist colonial politics. All roads truly lead back to Rome. My Roman Empire is it that it never actually ended but instead reincarnated through the Church. It’s no surprise that evangelical Christians are central to the modern colonial right.

Religion and spirituality have always been crucial tools for empire-building, so I wish this creator had also acknowledged that trans and non-binary people were the spiritual leaders of Indigenous societies—across literally every continent. 

I completely agree that there’s a subconscious jealousy of the freedom trans and non-binary people embody. But beyond that, our Indigenous spiritual healers have historically been the ones who guide us to freedom on other planes of existence. Fascists crave control, and they fear anything or anyone who can liberates us.
