Number one, break this overwhelming task into tiny manageable steps for me. Number two, give me a five minute motivation speech to start this task now. Number three, turn this boring task into a fun challenge or game. Number four, write me a simple script to ask for help without feeling guilty. Number five, I have 10 minutes. What's the one thing I should do first? Number six, turn my to-do list into an easy to follow schedule. Number seven, help me start this task by writing the first sentence for me. Number eight, create a reward system to keep me motivated. Number nine, write a gentle but firm reminder to stop scrolling and start working.
