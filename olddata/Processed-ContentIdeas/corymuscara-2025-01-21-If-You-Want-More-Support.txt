“Today allowed me to look back at a repetitive pattern and realize that I can release it. I no longer have to hold onto the fear that started it. When I truly sat (having the longer time was really good) I felt what you call the Thud. For me it was a heart opening, a lightening, a lift in my physical form. Almost an expansion. And now I feel energized! The opposite from the exhaustion you mentioned earlier. In so much gratitude, I will be consciously looking to maintain and return to this. So helpful to know what it feels like in my body.” -Pamela (comment from Day 24)

“I am so incredibly grateful for this course. I feel a shift that I have journaled, prayed and wanted for years slowly taking place. This is life changing.” -Lori B
