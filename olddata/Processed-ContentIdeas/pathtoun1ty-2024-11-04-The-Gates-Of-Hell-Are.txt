“The gates of hell are locked from the inside.” — C.S. Lewis
A powerful line by Lewis suggesting that much of our inner suffering is self-created. Often, we hold the key to freedom but remain trapped by our own choices, fears, and resistance to change. Undeniably there are horrendous circumstances which just happen to us. Still in the worst of situations and times, there might lie a deeper realisation hidden. Acknowledging our being as this conscious space itself, might at least aid some distance and relief. That is true liberation, and it might be closer than we think. It starts with unlocking our own minds.

Lewis always seemed to me as one of the more interesting advocates for religion. Having been an atheist himself, his arguments target the core doubts of many from a more comprehensible perspective. You can notice that he knows how it is to be one.
