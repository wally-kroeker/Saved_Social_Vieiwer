My most popular video of 2024 👀

With New Year’s resolutions coming in hot.. this message felt more appropriate now than ever. 

Self improvement can be great and transformative, and just like anything can also be taken too far. 

When focus on what is wrong and what needs to be “fixed” we will always be able to find something. That puts us on a treadmill always running after a carrot. We’ll never get to that enlightened, healed place. It’s a trap.

The goal is not to be a perfect being with no triggers, blemishes, or rough patches. 

The goal is to be human. To be present with what is. To gain acceptance of ourselves and be able to hold our experience with compassion and care.

Sending so much love to you 🫶🏼
