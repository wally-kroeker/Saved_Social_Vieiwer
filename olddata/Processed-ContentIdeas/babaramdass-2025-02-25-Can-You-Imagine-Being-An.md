# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: You imagine being an environment such that when you walk down the street, everybody that sees you feels at home. That you're an environment that would allow everybody to feel safe, feel loved, feel protected, feel trusted, feel beautiful, feel they had a right to exist if they chose to. You and I are environments for each other. We're the soil in which the flowers around us grow. Just keep your soil, keep yourself moist, fertile, soft, open, pliable, present, clear. It's amazing. It's like you live in a world in which flowers are blooming all around you everywhere you look. What grace I must have that everywhere I am flowers bloom.
