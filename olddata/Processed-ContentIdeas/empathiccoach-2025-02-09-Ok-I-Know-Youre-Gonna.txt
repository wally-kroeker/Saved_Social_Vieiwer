Ok I know you’re gonna say it sounds boring or it sounds like death. Meanwhile I’m sure many of you are there or almost there, aside from the excessive coffee (nothing wrong with coffee ), perfectionism and workaholism.... NO JUDGEMENT ok? 

For me this all came together about 6 months ago when I finally gave up my last highly addictive dependency. 

What you can expect may follow is something called ANHEDONIA, which is where life loses all joy - but if you just hang in there and implement those healthier choices like music, movement, mindfulness and a compassionate mindset, spending time in nature, with people you love, eating to sustain your needs and finding ways to express your creativity, over time your natural sources of dopamine will (somewhat) be revived. Many supplements you can take to help you with this as well.
