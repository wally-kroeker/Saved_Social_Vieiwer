# Full Transcription

~Dr. Lisa Marie Delrio~: Fear is sacred for men. Let me show you what's wild about the male brain. The amygdala, which is involved in the processing of emotions, is naturally larger in men. But more than that, in processing emotions, the right side of the amygdala fires up for men. The right side of the amygdala focuses only on primal negative emotions like fear. Just to contrast, women experience emotions more on the left side of the amygdala, which includes both negative and positive emotions, like happiness. Women feel all the things, but for men, this little piece of data shows us that men actually feel negative emotions more immediately and more potently than women. However, fear, socially, is a vulnerability. It carries this connotation of weakness. I am afraid translates to I am weak or soft. And men are not socialized to show weakness. And now loneliness, which is really just a loss of connection to your own emotions, and suicide, which becomes a solution to escape this pain, are epidemics among men. So let me just say this. The evolutionary purpose of fear is to ensure survival. Fear says, what is precious is not safe, and then the body moves to protect. And so holding this fear, this sacred vulnerability and transmuting it into courage is what keeps all of us safe. As long as predators exist in this world, we need men who are deeply in touch with and unashamed of the sensation of fear. Honored awareness of your fear, man, moving that energy in a productive way, directing that fear toward prosocial behaviors are wholly duties. Because it is this sacred vulnerability in men that sends evil back to the hell it came from and stabilizes society as we evolve. We love men. We love men and we need them.
