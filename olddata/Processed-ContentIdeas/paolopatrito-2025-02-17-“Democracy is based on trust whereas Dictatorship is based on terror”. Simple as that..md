# Full Transcription

~Yuval Noah Harari~: key issue is that democracy is based on trust, whereas dictatorship is based on terror. If you, I mean, if you systematically destroy trust in institutions, destroy trust in the media, in academia, in the courts and so forth. Some people think that this is liberating the people. So that from these institutions. It's not. When you destroy all trust, the only thing that can still work is a dictatorship. So this is what would be dictators do. They systematically destroy trust. And the other thing to realize is that the vast majority of information is not truth. A key misconception, especially in places like Silicon Valley, is to equate information with truth. Most information is junk. I mean, the truth is a very rare and costly and precious uh uh subkind of of of information because, you know, to write truthful story, you need to invest a lot of time and effort and money in research and fact checking, whereas fiction is very, very cheap.
