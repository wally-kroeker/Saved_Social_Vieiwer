# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: I just built this AI agent system to create and publish these POV style videos that are getting millions of views, and I'm sharing it to everyone. In case you haven't seen them, POV style videos like these are getting tens of millions of views, and you can actually automate the creation of these videos through AI and no code. This account, for example, already has more than 400,000 followers, but only has something like 15 videos. So you can just see how powerful this could be once it's automated. So what you can do is set up this workflow once and let AI do the rest of the work for you as you watch your channel grow. Because how it works is you basically give any topic to this AI system. For this example, I gave it a topic of famous people throughout history. It then creates detailed prompts, which are now fed to an image and video model to generate videos like this one, and also feeds that to a sound effects model for background music, then stitches those elements together to come up with full videos like this.

And publishes it to the social media channels of our choice. For the full tutorial and for a copy of this blueprint, which you can just upload, check out our community just in my profile link.
