# Full Transcription

~Speaker 1~: I created this AI automation for businesses that want to use AI within their business, but don't know what to do and don't know what tools to use. This automation uses perplexity to do research on your business, and it adds your business to the store of memory. And then when we get to the central workflow AI agent, it actually checks to see if there's any relevant industries to yours, and then sees if you have similar pain points as what you mentioned in the form, and then uses that to create a recommendation for automations for your business. And in this memory store, it has hundreds and hundreds of automations that your business could use, and it's specifically tailored to industries. Now, here's the form you can fill out. You just need to fill out these fields and make sure you fill out the correct email, and you'll get an email sent to you with these automations that are, you know, tailored to your business. And here's what it might look like. So, you'll see that we've got two recommendations for automations based on your business and based on your industry. So this is really tailored to you. So make sure you put as much detail into the form as possible because you're going to get a really good output if so. The link's in my bio, so try it out, see what kind of automations your business needs.
