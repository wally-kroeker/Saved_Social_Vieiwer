# Meeting Description

Okay, here's a consolidated and cleaned-up description of the event, addressing the points you requested:

**1. Participants:**

*   **Primary Speaker (Woman):**  The main presenter.  We don't have her name.
*   **Hugh Jackman:** Referenced, but not a participant. His image is used as a visual aid, and he's mentioned in the context of daily habits (meditation). He is not present in the meeting.

**2. Participant Descriptions:**

*   **Primary Speaker:** A blonde woman with her hair pulled back, wearing a blue hoodie. She appears to be a therapist, coach, or counselor based on her discussion topics and professional demeanor. She speaks with passion and earnestness, using hand gestures and maintaining direct eye contact (likely with a camera, as this seems to be a pre-recorded video or a live online presentation). She presents herself as knowledgeable and insightful, drawing on her experiences with clients.
*   **Hugh Jackman:** Only present as a smiling photograph.

**3. What Was Discussed and Shown/Covered:**

*   **Topic:** The core discussion revolves around a recurring pattern the speaker observes in her male clients, particularly concerning their spiritual growth and relationships.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Meditation as a Daily Habit:** The speaker begins by emphasizing the importance of daily meditation, drawing a parallel to showering. Hugh Jackman is mentioned in relation to this point.
    *   **"Shadow" (Jungian Psychology):** The speaker introduces the concept of the "shadow self," referring to the unconscious and often repressed aspects of a person's personality. She specifically discusses how many of her male clients tend to perceive others as "representations of their own shadow." This suggests a tendency to project their own inner issues and unresolved conflicts onto the people around them.
    *   **Gender Differences in Spiritual Perception:** The speaker observes a difference in how this "shadow projection" manifests between men and women. She notes that she doesn't see the same pattern "in reverse" (i.e., women projecting their shadow onto men in the same way).
    *   **Enlightenment and Relationships:** The speaker describes a common scenario where men, after undergoing some form of enlightenment or spiritual awakening, attempt to guide their female partners along a similar path. However, they often come to realize that their partners were already spiritually aware or "there" in terms of spiritual development. This highlights a potential underestimation of the female partner's spiritual depth.
    * **Genetic and Essence Differences:** The speaker briefly touches on the genetic differences between male and female brains, and the essence of masculine and feminine traits.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   A picture of Hugh Jackman smiling.
    *   The speaker in a room with a dark green wall, a bookshelf filled with books, and a microphone.
    *   Text overlays on the screen, emphasizing key phrases:
        *   "I wanna share something that happens with a lot of my male clients"
        *   "like you gotta understand this thing"
        *   "how do I live in a way where everyone is a representation of my own shadow"
        *   "that narrative I have seen quite a bit and I don't really see it in reverse"

**4. Additional Information (Type of Event):**

This is *not* a typical interactive meeting. It's most likely a segment from a:

*   **Pre-recorded Video:** Possibly part of an online course, workshop, or informational video series on psychology, relationships, or personal development.
*   **Live Online Presentation/Webinar:** The speaker could be delivering this information live to a virtual audience, but the format is primarily a presentation rather than a discussion.

The speaker is delivering information and insights based on her professional experience, using visuals and text overlays to emphasize key points. The tone is informative and aimed at educating the audience about the observed psychological patterns.

*   **Meeting Type:** This is likely a pre-recorded video or a segment from a live online presentation or workshop, rather than a typical interactive meeting. The speaker is delivering information directly to the audience.

In summary, the woman is sharing her professional observations about a psychological pattern she sees in her male clients, relating it to the concept of the "shadow self" and how individuals project their inner issues onto others.



# Full Transcription

~[Speaker Name]~: I want to share something that happens with a lot of my male clients.


~[Speaker Name]~: And I'll use Hugh Jackman as an example here.


~[Speaker Name]~: Someone was asking Hugh Jackman, how do you meditate every single day? How do you find time to meditate every single day?


~[Speaker Name]~: And he said, it's just like showering, where even if you have kids, you still don't skip your shower.


~[Speaker Name]~: To which all women everywhere said, what do you mean you've had to never skip a shower because of your kids?


~[Speaker Name]~: But more than just the concept of women waking up and adjusting to the needs of those around them, I want to talk about something that happens when men experience enlightenment type experiences.


~[Speaker Name]~: They'll start meditating or they'll do some kind of drug and they'll have an experience of oneness where I am love and I'm connected to everything. They understand now what people are talking about when they say I feel the divine, they have some kind of experience.


~[Speaker Name]~: And the first thing they'll often do is look at their partner, their female partner, if we're talking about a heterosexual relationship and say, you've got to read this book, you've got to come with me on retreat, you've got to try this drug combination. Like you got to understand this thing.


~[Speaker Name]~: And then after a while as they continue on their kind of enlightenment path, they start to realize, oh, what do I do with this? Like how do I function in the world after having an experience like this?


~[Speaker Name]~: And this is very common. Z Dog talked about this on YouTube recently where once you start to ask the question of what do I do now? Like how do I walk in the world?


~[Speaker Name]~: They find that their female partner, who they've kind of looked down on because they weren't reading the same books that they were reading, is already in that place.


~[Speaker Name]~: She was already there and he, thinking he was being enlightened, was only just catching up to her.


~[Speaker Name]~: And it's so interesting to work with so many male clients who either realize this kind of as we're uncovering it or they've realized this in the past that they maybe perhaps looked down on their female partner because she didn't know the words or she did she wasn't as interested in kind of some of the retreats and some of the drug combinations. But when it got down to how do I live? How do I live in a way where everyone is a representation of my own shadow that I can work on and I can understand people at that deeper level. How do I act in such a way that it changes how I show up with my family dynamic where I really act as if I am you and you are me in this place of love. And then they'll find that their female partner is already there and that she was more of a spiritual teacher than they realized, but they just missed it.


~[Speaker Name]~: And as always when I'm talking about men and women, I allow you to meet that however you want to meet that.


~[Speaker Name]~: We can talk about genetic differences overall in our brains that women's brains seem to be more interrelational within itself.


~[Speaker Name]~: Sometimes we're also talking about the essence of we've just defined these traits as masculine and these traits as feminine and everybody has both sides.


~[Speaker Name]~: And often some general trend that I'm referring to doesn't apply to you and that's great.


~[Speaker Name]~: But it's happened enough with male clients where they realize that their wife or their partner or their girlfriend was far more of a spiritual teacher than they thought they were when they were at the beginning stages of their enlightenment journey. That narrative I have seen quite a bit and I don't really see it in reverse.
