We posted a video series where Nick tells a partner he’s going abroad for work and plans to move with his nesting partner, Millie. Some viewers suggested we flip the script and show Millie rejecting that plan, with Nick instead going abroad with another partner. Ironically, this subversion mirrors our lived reality more closely than the original scenario. Millie is generally hesitant to move again for Nick’s career, especially if the new location doesn’t align with her interests.

This highlights the beauty of egalitarian polyamory: you’re not bound by monocentric norms that dictate the most established couple must always make major life decisions together. In our dynamic, it’s just as likely that Nick could move to another country with a different partner. In fact, before Nick’s last breakup, the plan had been for Millie and Nick to denest, as Millie prefers living alone, and for Nick to move full-time with his other partner. Egalitarian polyamory allows for flexibility and individuality, breaking free from the idea that one partner or relationship always takes precedence.
