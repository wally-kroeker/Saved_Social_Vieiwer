# Instagram Videos Viewer Update: Enhanced Transcript Experience ðŸš€

Just released an update to my personal Instagram Videos Viewer that makes reading transcripts a much better experience!

## What's New:
- ðŸ“Œ Close button now stays fixed when scrolling through long transcripts
- ðŸ“± Better positioning for both desktop and mobile viewing
- ðŸ‘€ Increased font size for improved readability
- ðŸŽ¨ Consistent dark mode styling throughout

One of those small UI improvements that makes a big difference in everyday use. Reading long transcripts is now much more pleasant without losing navigation controls!

Check out the full blog post (link) for technical details on how this was implemented with just a few lines of HTML/CSS changes.
